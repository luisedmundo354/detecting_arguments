Tax advisor had reason to know that multiple business entity structure he sold, in which small business owner would establish separate management company in form of subchapter S corporation, which would then create employee stock ownership plan to collect management fees paid to company by owner to reduce his taxable income, lacked any legitimate business purpose and was established solely to defer recognition of income, warranting issuance of injunction preventing advisor from promoting or selling any tax plans involving structure; structure created invalid employee stock ownership plan because small business owner\rquote s other employees were not permitted to participate in plan.

Tax advisor had reason to know that multiple business entity structure he promoted, in which small business owner would establish separate management company in form of subchapter S corporation, which would then sell its stock to Roth Individual Retirement Account (IRA) and collect management fees from owner to reduce his taxable income, lacked any legitimate business purpose and was established solely to defer recognition of income, warranting issuance of injunction preventing advisor from promoting or selling any tax plans involving structure; in establishing structure, defendant ignored revenue ruling finding that Roth IRAs could not own shares in subchapter S corporations.

With respect to issues of credibility, the Court is free to believe all, none, or some of a witness\rquote  testimony. The Court will not parse the testimony of witnesses, nor will it detail how and why it resolved issues related to credibility or impeachment.

Defendant received a bachelor of science degree in business administration from Missouri Western State College, and an MBA with an emphasis in marketing and finance from Northwest Missouri State University. He earned a law degree from the University of Missouri\u8212\'3fKansas City in 1987. Later, Defendant took courses toward an LLM in taxation at UMKC, but he did not complete the program. He has passed the necessary tests to be licensed as a CPA, although he is not licensed in Missouri because he did not complete the practical experience requirements imposed in that state. He has been licensed to practice law in Missouri since 1990 and is a member of the Missouri Bar and the bar of this Court.

Defendant worked for the international accounting firm of Coopers & Lybrand for approximately six years: four years in St. Louis and two years in Kansas City. While in St. Louis, his duties consisted of drafting and seeking revenue rulings and private letter rulings from the IRS. At trial, he testified this is a very common method for obtaining guidance on technical tax matters. While neither form of pronouncement from the IRS is a final declaration of the law, it constitutes the Government\rquote s position on the matter. Private letter rulings can be relied upon only by the taxpayer seeking the ruling, but revenue rulings have broader applicability and can be relied upon by other taxpayers. Defendant\rquote s other duties included performing tax research and drafting opinions and memoranda. In 1993, he began working at Grant Thornton LLP\rquote s office in Kansas City, Missouri, first as a tax manager, later as a senior tax manager, and finally as a tax principal.

Defendant is currently a 1/3 partner in Kruse Mennillo. The current managing partner, Victor Kawana, declined to say Defendant was in charge of Kruse Mennillo\rquote s tax practice, but conceded Defendant brought a \u8220\'3flevel of sophistication\u8221\'3f that had not been seen previously. Joining Defendant in the move from Grant Thornton to Kruse Mennillo were Angela Parker (a CPA and attorney) and Jenny Swearngin and Kelly Webb (CPAs).

The Government\rquote s case focuses on three multiple business entity structures sold and arranged by Defendant, the first two of which were primarily sold while Defendant was at Grant Thornton. The first is what the parties have referred to as the parallel C structure, and the second is the ESOP/S structure. Defendant also sold the ESOP/S structure for a short period of time after he moved to Kruse Mennillo. The third structure, the Roth/S structure, was only sold when Defendant was at Kruse Mennillo.

All three structures have a common thread: they are premised on a business owner forming a separate business denominated as a management company. The \u8220\'3foperating company\u8221\'3f\u8212\'3fthe initial, pre-existing business\u8212\'3fretains the new company to perform \u8220\'3fmanagement services.\u8221\'3f Fees paid to the management company are expenses that reduce the operating company\rquote s taxable income. Defendant contends\u8212\'3fcorrectly\u8212\'3fthat such structures are common. However, \u8220\'3fcommon\u8221\'3f does not automatically mean \u8220\'3flawful\u8221\'3f or \u8220\'3fvalid.\u8221\'3f Depending on the execution, the transaction can amount to nothing more than a sham. Moreover, these particular arrangements were unlawful regardless of the specifics of their execution. In this regard, the Court notes and rejects one of Defendant\rquote s frequent arguments justifying his actions: that certain transactions can be lawful without regard to whether the ones he promoted actually were.

 This structure was developed and promoted by others at Grant Thornton\rquote s Kansas City office before Defendant became employed. Defendant began recommending them to clients after he joined the firm. The structure was sold to small business owners who owned corporations that elected subchapter S status under the Internal Revenue Code. Normally, money earned by a corporation is subject to taxation twice: once as income to the corporation, and again when the owner receives dividends. A subchapter S election allows the corporation to become a \u8220\'3fpass through\u8221\'3f entity, so that income is not subject to taxation at the corporate level.

Once the operating company elected subchapter S status, the management company would be established in Nevada through a company owned by James Hoeppner called Nevada Corporation Associates (\u8220\'3fNCA\u8221\'3f). The primary reason for incorporating in Nevada was that state\rquote s lack of an income tax. The management company had no employees or property in Nevada, and its only \u8220\'3fpresence\u8221\'3f in that state would be NCA\rquote s address. The operating company\rquote s tax year was the traditional January 1\u8211\'3fDecember 31, but the management company would elect to have a fiscal year starting on December 1 and ending on November 30 of the following year. The sole shareholder of both corporations would be the same person or persons (namely, the original business-owner/client).

 In December, the operating company would accrue its \u8220\'3fmanagement fee expenses\u8221\'3f for the following year, and pay them to the management company. Thus, for instance, an operating company might claim and pay $300,000 as the following year\rquote s management expenses on December 15, 1997, thereby taking a deduction in 1997. However, the transaction is documented in the first month of the management company\rquote s tax year, thereby deferring any taxation on the $300,000 at least until the management company pays taxes for its fiscal year ending November 30, 1998.

 Under this standard, the management fees are material because of the sheer amount of the supposed expense and the correlation between the fees and the operating company\rquote s revenues. The Court also finds the amount and nature of the fees were such that they were material for financial statement purposes. With regard to the matching requirement, the accrual of the expense in the tax year preceding provision of the management services is not a \u8220\'3fmore proper match\u8221\'3f than recognizing the expense as management services are provided.

Defendant also insinuates that he should not have known anything was wrong with this structure because others at Grant Thornton developed and sold it. The Court is not persuaded by this reasoning. Just because other accountants and professionals were doing something wrong does not excuse Defendant\rquote s misconduct. In concluding that Defendant knew or should have known the structure was flawed, the Court relies not only on Defendant\rquote s background, education and experience, but also on the fact that the provisions signaling the structure\rquote s invalidity are not obscure or hypertechnical provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. Another factor is the complete absence of any explanation or justification as to how the structure could be acceptable under the law.

As events unfolded, in December 1998 the operating company recorded an expense to reflect the management fee in the amount of $350,000. This reduced the operating company\rquote s taxable income by $350,000 for the 1998 tax year and the income was reported by Magellan as income for the November 1998\u8211\'3fOctober 1999 fiscal year. This resulted in an improper deferral of the income. In reality, no money ever moved between the companies. All transactions appeared in financial books and records, but the operating company never actually transferred money to Magellan. All book entries necessary to create the illusion of actual transactions came from people acting at Defendant\rquote s direction.

Jerry Bain owned Temp\u8211\'3fCon, a company that provided heating and cooling services for commercial properties. In 1997, Defendant advised Bain to adopt the parallel C structure and to that end arranged for the formation of a management company called Integrated Construction Management Systems, Inc., or ICMSI, incorporated in Nevada. As with Clark Thomas Construction, Temp\u8211\'3fCon did not actually pay management fees; the income and expenses only appeared as entries on the companies\rquote  books. In fact, ICMSI did not even have a bank account until 2003. ICMSI supposedly provided management services, but Bain was its only employee and Bain continued to provide the same services for Temp\u8211\'3fCon as he had before ICMSI was formed. ICMSI was supposed to lease equipment to Temp\u8211\'3fCon, but ICMSI owned no equipment so the purported lease payments made to ICMSI were sham transactions. Finally, both companies were controlled by Bain, but nothing was done to insure that any transactions between them qualified as

Defendant repeatedly contends (both here and in other contexts) that he cannot be responsible for the failure of the taxpayers\u8212\'3fhis clients\u8212\'3fto properly observe all the formalities and distinctions between the companies. To the contrary, he can: he advised his clients to set up these entities in order to save taxes without also advising them of the potential pitfalls and the actions necessary to guard against the obvious conclusion that the transaction was a sham and bore no relation to reality. Defendant provided half-truths, and he is responsible for false and fraudulent statements made as a consequence of his failure to tell clients the complete truth.

 for the particulars, including Defendant\rquote s subordinates (Angela Parker, Jenny Swearngin and Kelly Webb among others), but this does not absolve him. While Defendant strived mightily to distance himself from the process of determining book entries, the Court finds that he is the common thread. The following point cannot be overemphasized: those who were personally involved received their direction from Defendant. Sometimes this took the form of specific transactions and entries that Defendant directed be made. Most of the time this took the form of instructions he made to his underlings regarding procedures and practices to be followed with respect to his clients.

Defendant also extolls the legitimate purposes for the structure. He contends the parallel C structure protects assets, facilitates asset transfers, and makes a sale of the business more attractive to potential buyers. There are three major flaws with this argument. First, none of these purposes were offered by Defendant to his clients as reasons for adopting the structure. Second, Defendant\rquote s clients were persuaded to pay Defendant to arrange the structure precisely and solely because of the promised tax savings.

The management fees paid by the operating company obtained an indefinite deferral: the income to the management company was not taxed because it made an election under subchapter S, and an ESOP\rquote s income is not subject to taxation. Thus, the operating company gains a deduction in the amount of the management fees, and those fees are not taxed until money is distributed from the ESOP.

In 1999, Defendant told Clark and Thomas they needed to take additional steps to garner even greater tax savings; this is when he persuaded them to utilize the ESOP/S arrangement. Southwest Construction Industries, Inc. (\u8220\'3fSW Construction\u8221\'3f) was formed in December 1999 and opted to be treated as a normal corporation for tax purposes. In 1999, Clark Thomas Construction \u8220\'3fallocated\u8221\'3f $182,434 of its expenses to Magellan, which helped offset the $350,000 that Clark Thomas Construction previously \u8220\'3fpaid\u8221\'3f Magellan for management fees. In reality, Magellan did not pay Clark Thomas Construction\rquote s expenses; they were, as they always had been, paid by the operating company. That same year, Clark Thomas Construction allocated another $171,522 of its expenses to SW Construction.

To prepare for the following year, in 1999 Clark Thomas Construction also claimed a management fee expense in the amount of $617,552, which (consistent with the operations of the parallel C structure) was income for Magellan in 2000. The same process played out in 2000, but this time SW Construction elected to be treated as a subchapter S corporation. Another S corporation\u8212\'3fSouthwest Resource Management, Inc. (\u8220\'3fSW Resource\u8221\'3f)\u8212\'3fwas also created. ESOPs were established for both of the S corporations. Magellan indicated it received $617,552 in the fiscal year ending October 2000. That same year, Magellan indicated it incurred its own management fee expenses: $238,000 each to SW Construction and SW Resource, for a total of $476,000. Clark Thomas Construction also allocated $140,607 of its expenses to Magellan, leaving Magellan with no income. Ultimately, the ESOPs each received the $238,000 reflected in the paperwork but it came directly from Thomas Clark Construction and not Magellan. Once again, the operating company\rquote s profits escaped taxation.

From its inception, this particular arrangement suffered an additional infirmity: it was formed after Congress passed legislation to prevent it.

Defendant sent Dr. Barnes a letter dated September 4, 2001, confirming that he had been retained to prepare a new Nevada corporation and a corresponding ESOP and ESOT. Defendant arranged with NCA for Dr. Barnes to obtain a previously created corporation (a \u8220\'3fshelf corporation\u8221\'3f) that had been formed in May 1992. During trial Defendant was asked how the formation of the ESOP could be deemed to occur before March 14, 2001, given that Dr. Barnes did not acquire the corporation (Sterling Warner) until the fall of that year. Defendant explained that Sterling Warner already had an ESOP, so Dr. Barnes bought the previously-created ESOP when he bought the previously-created corporation.

There is nothing particularly unusual about this ESOP/S arrangement as compared to any others Defendant established. The Court mentions this particular arrangement because the Court found Ohmes\rquote  testimony to be particularly credible and helpful, particularly with respect to the issue of how the management fees were calculated. According to Ohmes, Defendant explained that \u8220\'3fdefensible\u8221\'3f amounts were to be attributed to the management company as a means of reducing the operating companies\rquote  income. At the end of the first year of the ESOP/S arrangement, Defendant communicated with Ohmes\rquote  accountant to establish the amount of fees and expenses to be attributed to ECASI.

In connection with those duties she prepared financial statements near the end of 2000 reflecting the operating company\rquote s activities and sent those statements to individuals designated by Defendant to work on Simpson and Sons\rquote  tax matters. The statements were returned to Ussary with additional entries and instructions that the changes had to be made. Ussary did not have an accounting background, but she knew enough about the sawmill\rquote s business and the reports she prepared to realize the added transactions did not reflect actual events or the way Simpson and Sons did business. She reported her concerns to her brother, but he did not have a detailed understanding of the transactions or the business structure: he adopted the ESOP/S because of Defendant\rquote s representations and, not being an accountant or a lawyer, Stephen trusted Defendant\rquote s statements and assurances. After hearing his sister\rquote s concerns, Stephen contacted Defendant and Defendant came to the sawmill to meet with Stephen and Daria. Defendant reassured Stephen and Daria that he knew what he was doing, that the structure was legal, and that the transactions and numbers conveyed to them needed to be added to the operating company\rquote s books.

Raymond Anderson and his two sons, Scott and Eric, each owned a one-third interest in SEAKR Engineering; Raymond was the President and later the CEO. SEAKR manufactured electronics for the space industry. The Andersons were also equal partners in Pacific Instruments Partnership. Pacific Instruments was created by the Andersons before they met Defendant; it purchased and owned equipment and land, then leased the equipment and land to SEAKR. SEAKR was an S corporation and, as its name implies, Pacific Instruments was a general partnership. In 1999, Defendant established an ESOP/S structure for these two companies and to that end Defendant arranged for NCA to form CVL Management Consultants on the Andersons\rquote  behalf. The Andersons each owned one-third of CVL\rquote s stock, and each transferred their shares to separate ESOPs established solely for them. Thus, CVL\rquote s income (which was not taxed because CVL was an S corporation) was not income to the Andersons but rather income to the ESOPs, thereby evading taxation.

 Despite CVL\rquote s formation in August, SEAKR deducted more than $3.2 million in accrued management fee expenses for 1999 and paid it $1,000 in cash and provided a note for the balance. The deduction of $3.2 million reduced SEAKR\rquote s income to slightly less than $69,000. Keeping in mind that SEAKR\rquote s income was split three ways (because there were three owners), the arrangement reduced each Anderson\rquote s income from SEAKR from over $1 million to approximately $23,000. In 2000, SEAKR claimed a management fee expense of more than $4.6 million. It paid CVL slightly more than $1 million in cash and a note for the balance, leaving SEAKR with income of $43,017 to be attributed to the owners. In 2001, SEAKR claimed a management fee expense of more than $5 million; it paid this sum plus $950,000 on the previous year\rquote s note to CVL. SEAKR\rquote s income for the year was reduced to $56,019. In 2002, SEAKR claimed an expense of more than $4.3 million and paid more than $3.9 million; its income for the year was reduced to $53,526.

He found what he sought in the Roth/S arrangement. Like the ESOP/S, the Roth/S called for the creation of a \u8220\'3fmanagement company\u8221\'3f eligible to take the subchapter S election. A Roth IRA would purchase the management company\rquote s stock. Thus, (1) the management fees reduce the operating company\rquote s income, (2) the management company\rquote s income would not be taxed because it was a subchapter S corporation, and (3) the resulting income allocations made to the Roth IRA would not be taxed because an IRA\rquote s earnings are not taxable. The distributions from the Roth IRA to its owner (after age 59 \u189\'3f) also would not be taxed\u8212\'3fso the amount designated as management fees would forever escape taxation.

 is exceeded, the taxpayer must pay a 6% excise tax on the excess. The Code also prescribes annual income limits above which a taxpayer may no longer contribute to a Roth IRA without incurring excise taxes. If a taxpayer\rquote s adjusted gross income exceeds this annual limit, then he incurs a 6% excise tax on any Roth IRA contribution he or she makes during that tax year. By reducing the operating company\rquote s income, the Roth/S reduced the owner\rquote s income, making people eligible for Roth IRAs who would otherwise not have been eligible. Moreover, by altering the path of the client\rquote s earnings by having them travel to the S corporation and then to the Roth IRA, the contribution limits were evaded.

In January 2002, Defendant prepared a timeline for the development of the structure in preparation for its sale by Kruse Mennillo. His stated goal was to sell 100 structures by July 1, 2002 at $65,000 per arrangement. His timeline included anticipated deadlines for (1) Sommers to complete a memo supporting the structure, (2) obtaining a second opinion from an outside law firm, (3) preparation of a \u8220\'3fTechnical Binder\u8221\'3f containing information to be distributed to \u8220\'3faffiliates\u8221\'3f and \u8220\'3fcorrespondents,\u8221\'3f and (4) arranging meetings with the affiliates and correspondents.

Sommers\rquote  memo takes two approaches in concluding the ruling was wrong. It starts by noting there are two variations for a Roth IRA: one in which the IRA is established as a custodial account and the other in which it is established as a trust. Generally, an IRA is a trust containing certain requirements and restrictions.

Of course, property in an IRA is not owned by the account holder in the same manner as other property. More importantly, Sommers did not address the underpinnings of Ruling 92\u8211\'3f73, which rests on larger concepts about subchapter S corporations: Congress decreed that taxes must be paid on the money earned by the pass-through entity by the owners of the entity.

Instead, Congress left intact the statutes that (1) limited ownership of S corporations to certain types of trusts and (2) required IRAs to follow distribution rules that were inconsistent with those limitations. The statutory change has no effect on the ruling\rquote s reasoning. Sommers then proceeded to ignore the ruling\rquote s reasoning, leaving the opinion with no basis for concluding or believing that (1) the statutory change applied to IRAs or (2) the reasoning of

Despite the precarious reasoning and the obvious oddity of a structure that precluded all taxation of income, Defendant did not seek further guidance from the IRS. This is particularly telling because Defendant\rquote s job duties once consisted of seeking guidance from the IRS specifically so clients would be assured of the legality of their actions. Instead, he sought a concurring legal opinion from a law firm in Missouri (Watkins Boulware); that opinion was authored by James Thomas.

Thomas\rquote  opinion thus suffers from the same flaws as Sommers\rquote  opinion, both in terms of the topics that are not addressed and in its analysis. Its analysis does not address the need for an S corporation\rquote s income to be taxed at some level. Thomas also was not asked to consider the transactions leading to the IRA\rquote s ownership of the management company, so he expressed no opinion about the effect of the contribution and income limits.

Parker expressed concerns about the Roth/S arrangement, primarily because it allowed a for-profit corporation\rquote s income to completely avoid taxation. She was also concerned about the possible application of the Unrelated Business Income Tax (\u8220\'3fUBIT\u8221\'3f). Parker was quite vocal in expressing her concerns, which prompted Defendant to ask Sommers to obtain a second opinion from James Thomas. By now, Thomas had left Watkins Boulware and was now at the Kansas City law firm of Husch & Eppenberger. Sommers contacted Thomas, and Thomas prepared a new opinion. The Record is not clear as to when the opinion was sent, but the Court finds that it was sent to Sommers sometime between July and October of 2003. The 2003 opinion essentially parrots Thomas\rquote  2002 opinion, although it was circulated among other attorneys at Husch & Eppenberger before being sent to Sommers.

As Thomas explained at trial, owning and operating a business is not related to an IRA\rquote s purpose, so ordinarily an IRA in that situation would be subject to UBIT. Thomas\rquote  opinion, however, reached a contrary conclusion. He relied on new provisions to the code passed in 1996 and 1997 that relate to ESOPs and S corporations, but he misapprehended the purpose of those provisions.

The Roth IRA\rquote s very first transaction violated the contribution limits. While the taxpayer deposited an acceptable amount, the Roth IRA used those funds to buy all of the stock of the management company. The problem is that the management company\rquote s stock was worth more than the amount paid by the Roth IRA. For instance, in 2002, the contribution limit was $3,000. A taxpayer would deposit that amount into the Roth IRA, and the Roth IRA would use those funds to buy all of the stock of the management company. However, the management company\rquote s stock was worth more than $3,000; the earning potential of the contract with the operating company (assuming that was valid), alone, made the management company worth more than $3,000. Defendant insists that stock is routinely sold for par value, but this is misleading: the real issue is the fair market value of the stock. The fair market value of the management company\rquote s stock exceeded the amount paid for it by the Roth IRA, so the excess constituted

In addition to maintaining an ESOP/S arrangement for Dr. Peter Wohrle\rquote s dental practice, Defendant also arranged for a Roth/C structure for a patent of Dr. Wohrle\rquote s. As the name suggests, the Roth/C structure is like the Roth/S, except the company owned by the Roth IRA does not take the election under subchapter S. The Court finds that Dr. Wohrle, failed to properly execute certain transactions related to the patent. Had Dr. Wohrle executed the transactions properly, the Court doubts the overall plan would have violated the law.

The plan was implemented in 2001 and called for Dr. Wohrle to transfer his rights in a pending patent to the corporation and for the Roth IRA to then purchase the corporation\rquote s stock. At the time, the patent\rquote s value was nominal. There was no license; there was not even a patent at the time. The plan then called for any income stream earned by the patent to flow from the corporation to the Roth IRA for eventual distribution to Dr. Wohrle.

{\b0 \cf19 \f2 \ul0 \strike0 \i0 \fs20 \sa0 \sb0 
 While any income might be subject to taxation when earned by the corporation, it would not be taxed when it was distributed from the Roth IRA to Dr. Wohrle.

The Government has not clearly explained the impropriety in this situation. The Government concedes the asset acquired by the corporation was of nominal value, so there can be no claim that an excess contribution was generated when the IRA purchased the stock. Any money flowing from the corporation to the IRA would be a dividend or return of capital and would not constitute a contribution. The invention was patented and in 2003 was licensed to a pharmaceutical company and thus appreciated in value. However, it appreciated in value after it was already owned by the corporation and after the IRA purchased the corporation\rquote s stock.

As events unfolded, Dr. Wohrle failed to heed the different entities\rquote  roles. He executed the patent licensing agreement in his own name and personally received the royalties. He then deposited those royalties into his Roth IRA, which violated the contribution limits. Perhaps Defendant should have monitored his clients more closely, but on this Record the Court cannot conclude Defendant\rquote s advice was improper.

In reality, the investment companies owned by the IRAs had no substance: they had no business activity and did not even have a checking account. They were shams designed to disguise the transfer of the land from KL to the IRAs so that the property could be sold once developed without incurring tax. The Court also finds that Defendant engaged in a similar transaction for Kline and Laderoute involving Castlerock Development Company.

He told clients a legal opinion found \u8220\'3fsubstantial authority\u8221\'3f supporting the Roth/S, but did not tell clients the phrase has a technical meaning in the tax law that is vastly different than the meaning carried by the ordinary usage of the words.

Clients were told that NCA \u8220\'3fand other law firms and accounting firms\u8221\'3f may perform work on the project, and that those firms would bill separately for those services. Accordingly, an invoice was sent to clients from NCA; often, this was sent by Defendant on NCA\rquote s letterhead without Hoeppner\rquote s knowledge. Eighty to ninety percent of the fees remitted to NCA were later turned over to Defendant, thereby increasing the amount he received (but without increasing the total amount paid by clients).

While Defendant may not have known the details of any particular tax return, he created the procedures for completing those returns and knew that the product would be tax forms that did not accurately reflect the taxpayers\rquote  businesses.

Over the course of five years, Defendant moved from one scheme to another in an attempt to garner ever-increasing tax advantages. He started with a structure that provided for short-term deferral (the parallel C), but before the tax consequences of the deferral could be felt he had moved his clients to something promising longer deferral (the ESOP/S). Once Congress outlawed the ESOP/S, Defendant moved his clients to a structure that promised complete tax avoidance (the Roth/S). Along the way, of course, he gathered more and different clients.

Although difficult to quantify, the harm caused by Defendant is significant. Revenue agents testified the tax loss to the Government could have been as high as $800 million, although one agent (Janice Mallon) conceded a more reasonable estimation was $300 million. Very conservative estimates would place the tax loss at around $100 million. Regardless, the tax loss is significant. In addition, the Government has suffered harm because it has had to expend time, money and other resources to sort through the transactions and uncover Defendant\rquote s activities. Rhonda Kimball spent 2400 hours unraveling the Andersons\rquote  transactions, and another 800 hours investigating Clark Thomas Construction. These two clients, alone, consumed over year\rquote s work by a single agent. Finally, the Court acknowledges the clients left in Defendant\rquote s wake. They

Defendant\rquote s participation in these schemes was significant. While he did not develop the parallel C and ESOP/S plans, he promoted them. When he left Grant Thornton he brought the ESOP/S plan to Kruse Mennillo and began promoting it from that firm. He created at least one such structure after it was unlawful to do so. He brought Marc Sommers and the Roth/S to Kruse Mennillo and directed the marketing of that plan to clients. With respect to all three plans, Defendant met with clients, drafted documents, and directed subordinates.

An injunction prohibiting Defendant from providing tax advice raises serious First Amendment concerns. The Government has a strong and valid interest in preventing fraud, and the First Amendment does not protect fraudulent statements. However, the Government has no interest in preventing true statements, and even liars and hucksters have First Amendment rights. Conceivably, Defendant could provide lawful and accurate tax advice, and the Court is unwilling (and probably unable) to prevent him from doing so.

As will be discussed, certain amendments were passed that effectively curtailed Defendant\rquote s sale of ESOP/S arrangements. To avoid confusion, the code provisions cited are from the 1994 United States Code, as supplemented through 1998. The law did not change significantly in the respects described herein until 2001.

Defendant\rquote s argument that in some cases the management company\rquote s stock was owned by an Employee Stock Ownership Trust (ESOT) and not an ESOP is a red herring. Ultimately, the individual who owned the operating company controlled the management company, the ESOT, and the ESOP.

Thomas reviewed Sommers\rquote  opinion before drafting his own, and Defendant was a friend and business associate of Thomas\rquote  boss. However, the Court declines the Government\rquote s invitation to find that the outcome of Thomas\rquote  letter was dictated by either Defendant or Thomas\rquote  boss because the greater weight of the evidence does not support this fact.

One interesting question that was not clearly answered is whether the earnings on excess contributions are subject to the excise tax as well. The Court suspects this is so, but the answer is not important to the issues in this case.

Defendant presented the testimony of Steve Mather, an attorney representing the Coulter Group (one of Defendant\rquote s clients) to testify about the Coulter Group\rquote s operations. The Court did not find his testimony to be helpful, and makes no findings about the Coulter Group. It is not that Mather was not credible; he just did not have a sufficient basis for knowledge to persuade the Court that his conclusions about the Coulter Group were worthy of acceptance.

The Government presented an Offering Memorandum found in Defendant\rquote s house, announcing offers to sell ownership interests in an entity that had purchased large quantities of eyeglasses for a discount. The eyeglasses were then purportedly appraised to determine their fair market value. The plan calls for the donation of the eyeglasses to charities with the promise that investors can claim an itemized deduction for the charitable contribution based on the fair market value of the glasses and not on the amount actually spent to obtain them. Kruse Mennillo is identified as the financial advisor for the project.

The Court strongly suspects Defendant is involved in this project. The memorandum was found in his house. Kawana\rquote s testimony persuades the Court that a project such as this would have required the approval of all the partners. Kawana\rquote s testimony also persuades the Court that an idea of this scope and complexity would have been originated by Defendant. However, the Court was not presented with enough evidence to establish Defendant\rquote s involvement by the greater weight of the evidence.
