The defendant, the United States (\u8220\'3fgovernment\u8221\'3f or \u8220\'3fUnited States\u8221\'3f) argues that there are genuine issues of material fact that preclude summary judgment.

The history of this litigation may be summarized as follows. NatWest filed this suit in 1995 for a refund of its federal income tax for the tax years 1981 through 1987. NatWest is a publicly-held U.K. corporation engaged in a world-wide banking business, which is managed in the United Kingdom. During the years at issue, NatWest conducted business in the United States in both branch and subsidiary form. This case concerns the amount of profits that should be attributed to the U.S. branch operations of NatWest under Article 7 of the Convention for the Avoidance of Double Taxation, U.S.-U.K.,

\u8221\'3f), and January 2005 Order Denying Reconsideration (\u8220\'3fJanuary 18, 2005 Order\u8221\'3f), the court held that the government could not require NatWest to re-characterize loans from other branches to establish a 6%\u8211\'3f7% capital base, which was approximately equal to the amount that would have been required if the branch were a domestic subsidiary. Instead, the court agreed with NatWest that under the Treaty the court was bound to look at the business records of the entity and make adjustments only to the extent that the branch\rquote s capital was not properly identified in the branch\rquote s books and records. In this connection the court ruled that NatWest\rquote s position was consistent with the historic position of the U.K., as set forth in the United Kingdom\rquote s Inland Revenue Banking Manual (\u8220\'3fManual\u8221\'3f). The Manual provides a framework for determining deductible interest expense through two concepts: \u8220\'3fallotted capital,\u8221\'3f which is actually identified as capital on the branch\rquote s books and records, and \u8220\'3famounts treated as allotted capital,\u8221\'3f which are used to make adjustments to allotted capital. The court found, based on the guidance set forth in the Manual, that the \u8220\'3fproperly maintained books for the U.S. branch could be adjusted where: (1) an interest expense was deducted for advances

It is not disputed that NatWest maintained separate books and records for each of its branch offices in the United States. The manner in which NatWest maintained branch books and records is set forth in the declaration of Roger Walmsley, a NatWest employee from 1959 to 1995. Mr. Walmsley served as the manager of the San Francisco office from 1975 to 1979. From 1982 to 1987 he served as the deputy manager, and then manager, of the New York branch. He served as the head of international operations for NatWest from 1991 to 1995. Mr. Walmsley explains in his declaration that the daily activity of U.S. branch operations were entered on a computerized record keeping system, which would generate a number of daily and other periodic reports. Walmsley Decl. \u182\'3f\u182\'3f 13\u8211\'3f15. According to Mr. Walmsley, at the end of each fiscal quarter, the New York, Chicago, and San Francisco branch offices would prepare profit and loss statements and balance sheets based on the computerized records.

It is not disputed that during the tax years at issue in this litigation, 1981 through 1987, NatWest had six branch offices in the United States: (1) the New York Branch; (2) the IBF; (3) the Nassau Branch; (4) the Grand Cayman Islands Branch; (5) the Chicago Branch; and (6) the San Francisco Branch (sometimes referred to as the \u8220\'3fSan Francisco Overseas Branch\u8221\'3f or the \u8220\'3fSan Francisco Depository Agency\u8221\'3f). The first four branches were located in New York, in the same building. NatWest maintained separate profit and loss statements and balance sheets with respect to each branch office.

In support of its view, NatWest has submitted the declaration of Edward Jukes, a retired tax official of the United Kingdom Inland Revenue (\u8220\'3fInland Revenue\u8221\'3f). He served in various offices, including the International Division, where he served for ten years, from 1985 to 1995. Mr. Jukes retired from Inland Revenue as the head of Inland Revenue\rquote s Special Investigation Section. While working in the International Division, Mr. Jukes worked directly on investigations involving the computation of profits by foreign bank branches in the United Kingdom. It is Mr. Jukes\rquote  opinion that the Inland Revenue would have dealt with the branches in the aggregate. As he states in his declaration:

There were some foreign banks that had branches in more than one location in the U.K. during the 1980s. My recollection is that the Inland Revenue permitted these banks to file their accounts either on an aggregate basis or by separate physical location. The Inland Revenue would not have used separate underlying records reflecting a loss in one physical location in the United Kingdom to create an adjustment to capital when there were adequate profits in another U.K. location reported on the same U.K. income tax return. We certainly would not have used separate books maintained within a single physical location to create such an adjustment where their aggregate capital was sufficient.

I also recall that Inland Revenue was relaxed as to whether the taxpayer filed their accounts on an aggregate basis or by reference to physical locations. I do not think it would have been appropriate to evaluate the branches separately for purposes of computing amounts to be treated as Allotted Capital, even if they maintained separate sets of books, when the bank submitted its tax return as a single permanent establishment. If the permanent establishment was in profit overall, Inland Revenue would not, in my view, have argued that nevertheless capital should have been injected to cover the losses of what would have been just one part of a single profitable business for U.K. tax purposes.

Mr. Akin states: \u8220\'3f[M]y guess is that the UK Revenue would have readily accepted computations based on a single set of accounts for all branches if those were the only accounts produced, but would have wished to consider carefully whether the deliberate separation into branches or the deliberate amalgamation of the figures produced for separate branches was acceptable ....\u8221\'3f Akin Decl. \u182\'3f 44.

In conducting this task, NatWest endeavored to determine what amounts were \u8220\'3fallotted capital\u8221\'3f and which additional amounts, if any, should be \u8220\'3ftreated as allotted capital.\u8221\'3f NatWest based its examination on its reading of both the court\rquote s opinion and the Manual. NatWest therefore did not identify any specific percentage of economic \u8220\'3fcapital\u8221\'3f for its U.S. branch operations. Instead, NatWest examined its books and records to determine whether capital was provided to the branches to support operations, start up costs, or fixed assets and whether it paid interest on those amounts. Because it appears from the Manual that interest on capital infusions for these purposes should not be deducted from profits, NatWest needed to identify those payments and then correct its profit and loss statements to eliminate interest paid on those amounts. Based on its examination, NatWest contends that it has identified and conceded all interest expense erroneously deducted on capital.

NatWest produced evidence to show that from the inception of NatWest\rquote s U.S. branch operations in the 1970s, advances from the Head Office to branches outside the United Kingdom, which were used to purchase fixed assets or for other capital purposes such as initial working capital, were separately identified on the branches\rquote  books as \u8220\'3fCapital Loans.\u8221\'3f Scott Decl. \u182\'3f\u182\'3f 11\u8211\'3f12.

NatWest concedes that although branches did not, as a matter of policy, pay or deduct interest on advances to fund fixed asset purposes, the branches did pay an interest charge, called a \u8220\'3fcapital loan charge\u8221\'3f to the Head Office with respect to un-repatriated profits. Capital loan charges were paid on the excess of retained profits (plus any balances due to the head office for capital loans or fixed assets) over fixed assets. Jukes Decl. \u182\'3f 14. As NatWest explains in its reply brief, the capital loan charges could be viewed as retained profits that were automatically repatriated and advanced back to the branch as a loan.

Dr. Clair addresses Mr. Read\rquote s criticisms of his analysis regarding money market transactions. Dr. Clair states that he performed standard statistical tests to discern the presence of the problems identified by Mr. Read. Dr. Clair concludes that the test results \u8220\'3freaffirm my prior conclusion that the regression analysis shows that there is no statistically significant association between the interest rates on deposits or placements with the identity of the customer as a related or unrelated party.\u8221\'3f Clair Supp. Decl. \u182\'3f 35.

It is not disputed that clearing accounts at the U.S. branches allowed customers to make deposits and payments in U.S. dollars. These accounts worked much like checking accounts in which dollars were deposited that could then be used to make or receive payments to or from other parties.

 processing payments into and out of these accounts. In addition, the U.S. branches charged interest on negative overnight balances in the accounts (i.e., overdrafts) and paid interest (\u8220\'3fcredit interest\u8221\'3f) on positive overnight balances in the accounts. It is not disputed that when the balance was positive, the branch computed notional interest that reduced the fees or commission owed.

Based on the declarations of Mr. Walmsley, NatWest asserts that the U.S. branches always employed market rates and that no favors were given to related parties. NatWest concedes that the U.S. branches computed interest on clearing accounts using two pricing structures, which gave more favorable rates based on higher activity levels. Mr. Walmsley states, however, that related parties were treated the same as unrelated parties under the higher activity structure. Walmsley Decl. \u182\'3f 27. NatWest also relies on the work of Dr. Robert Clair, an economist with KPMG LLP and former economist with the Dallas Federal Reserve Bank. Dr. Clair states that his study of NatWest\rquote s rates confirms that more favorable rates were not based on status as a related party. Dr. Clair asserts that the more favorable rates were provided to both related and non-related parties with higher activity rates. Clair Rep. 33.

The government, relying on the declaration of Mr. James Read, an accountant with The Brattle Group, disagrees with NatWest\rquote s assertions and contends that there is evidence to show that some related party accounts were given a more favorable rate structure even though the related party had less activity than third parties with greater activity.

In response, NatWest has filed supplemental affidavits from Mr. Walmsley and Dr. Clair. They assert that Mr. Read\rquote s adjustment to income relates almost entirely (96.6%) to income received by the New York branch on a revolving loan provided to NatWest Commercial Services, Inc. NatWest states that revolving loans are not the same as clearing accounts. Walmsley Supp. Decl. \u182\'3f 3; Clair Supp. Decl. \u182\'3f\u182\'3f 46\u8211\'3f48, 60. NatWest also argues that NatWest Commercial Services, Inc. is an affiliate rather than a related party or a third party. NatWest therefore contends that Mr. Read\rquote s analysis of clearing accounts must exclude NatWest Commercial Services\rquote  revolving account. NatWest also questions Mr. Read\rquote s use of three months of data from the last two years at issue to create an adjustment covering all seven years. Clair Supp. Decl. \u182\'3f\u182\'3f 54\u8211\'3f55.

Summary judgment is authorized when \u8220\'3fthe pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u8221\'3f Rule 56(c) of the Rules of the United States Court of Federal Claims (\u8220\'3fRCFC\u8221\'3f). The applicable standards for analyzing a motion for summary judgment are well-established. The party moving for summary judgment bears the burden of showing the absence of any genuine issue of material fact and that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.

The government contends that NatWest is not entitled to summary judgment on the question of whether NatWest U.S. branches\rquote  books and records were \u8220\'3fproperly maintained.\u8221\'3f The government contends that the branches\rquote  books and records are not \u8220\'3fproperly maintained\u8221\'3f because they are not adequate to determine whether NatWest has made correct interest expense deductions for amounts that are capital or should be treated as capital, as provided for in the Inland Revenue Manual. In particular, the government claims that (1) NatWest failed to identify capital on the balance sheets of its branches and therefore the books and records do not provide an accurate picture of NatWest\rquote s branches\rquote  capital; (2) the books and records are only interim because the books and records do not necessarily reflect the final reconciliation prepared by the head office; (3) the books and records identify accumulated losses as an \u8220\'3fasset\u8221\'3f and therefore there is no identification of infusions of capital to cover such losses; and (4) the books and records contain anomalies which undermine their correctness, for example, fixed assets belonging to one branch are sometimes carried on the books of another branch and all of the employees in the four New York offices were carried on the New York branch\rquote s books.

In addition, the government complains that NatWest has not maintained the records necessary to perform the review provided for in the Manual. The government explains that the Manual puts the burden on NatWest to trace the source of the funds the branches used to purchase fixed assets. The government argues that NatWest has not retained (or at least has not made available) records of the amounts that its U.S. branches spent on fixed assets from the time they began operations in the U.S. to the end of the tax years at issue. The government argues that summary judgment should be denied because NatWest has not produced records that permit a full inquiry into each branch\rquote s capital.

NatWest maintains that the government has failed to identify any material fact that puts the accuracy or reliability of its U.S. branches\rquote  books and records into dispute. Rather, NatWest argues the government is challenging the conclusions to be drawn from these facts. For example, NatWest asserts that the presence of fixed assets on one branch\rquote s books for an asset located in another branch reflects the fact that the U.S. branches should be properly considered as a single entity; this fact does not undermine the accuracy or reliability of NatWest\rquote s branches books and records. NatWest makes the same argument with regard to the operating expenses for the four branches located in New York. NatWest further argues that it is not necessary to trace the acquisition of fixed assets because tracing is not required. Finally, NatWest does not dispute that there was an on-going reconciliation process between the U.S. branch offices and the Head Office, but contends that this process did alter the integrity of the branches\rquote  books and records. According to NatWest, the reconciliation process was akin to balancing a checkbook and the need to account for differences in check clearing dates.

The court agrees with NatWest that it is entitled to summary judgment on the issue of whether it has presented \u8220\'3fproperly maintained\u8221\'3f books and records. The undisputed facts demonstrate that: NatWest had a highly-regarded system for collecting information at its U.S. branches; NatWest\rquote s record keeping system was regularly checked for reliability; and the balance sheets and profit and loss statements submitted to the Head Office were certified as accurate to the best of the signer\rquote s knowledge.

The government has not provided the court with any facts that would lead the court to question the accuracy or reliability of NatWest\rquote s branch offices\rquote  books and records. Rather, the government\rquote s objections to NatWest\rquote s books and records are based on its legal view of the case. The government\rquote s objection to NatWest\rquote s failure to properly account for \u8220\'3fcapital\u8221\'3f turns on the government\rquote s contention that NatWest was legally obligated to identify \u8220\'3feconomic\u8221\'3f capital. This legal issue will be dealt with separately. Similarly, the government\rquote s objections to NatWest\rquote s inclusion of one branch\rquote s assets on another branch\rquote s balance sheet goes to the question of whether NatWest maintained one or six separate permanent establishments in the U.S. This issue will also be dealt with separately. Finally, the government\rquote s objections to NatWest\rquote s failure to produce all of the documents that would allow the court to trace the purchase of each branch office\rquote s fixed assets and premises turns on the government\rquote s contention that the Manual requires tracing. Again, this is a legal issue that will be dealt with separately.

 NatWest argues that under the Internal Revenue Code, the Treaty, and the Manual, NatWest operated a single permanent establishment and therefore the tax liability of branch offices may be properly determined on an \u8220\'3faggregated\u8221\'3f basis. NatWest contends that a foreign corporation engaged in a trade or business in the United States is required to calculate, report and pay taxes on its U.S. income on an aggregate basis. The foreign corporation is the taxpayer without regard to the number of business offices it maintains in the United States. The foreign corporation receives one employer identification number and files one tax return reporting all of its effectively connected income.

The government argues that whether NatWest operated a single permanent establishment or multiple establishments is a question of fact that turns on the particular circumstances at issue. Here, the government argues that because it is undisputed that NatWest did not combine the books and financial reports of each branch office for accounting purposes and included intra-branch transactions on each office\rquote s books and records, NatWest must account for profits and losses on a segregated basis. According to the government, under these undisputed facts NatWest maintained six separate permanent establishments in the United States and each must be accounted for separately for tax purposes. The government argues that NatWest cannot simply combine the books and records of the six offices and create a single permanent establishment for tax purposes.

The court agrees with NatWest that whether NatWest operated six U.S. permanent establishments or a single permanent establishment for Treaty and tax purposes is a question of law. The fact that NatWest operated separate banking operations in New York, San Francisco and Chicago does not mean that it operated several permanent establishments. The court agrees that under the Treaty the host country may tax profits if the foreign corporation operates an enterprise in the host country. Under Article 5(1) of the Treaty, \u8220\'3fpermanent establishment\u8221\'3f is defined to mean \u8220\'3fa fixed place of business through which the business of an enterprise is wholly or partly carried on\u8221\'3f in the host country. Here, the six NatWest branch offices carried on the business of the NatWest enterprise in the United Kingdom. The fact that the six offices maintained separate books and records for internal accounting purposes does not mean that the offices are not part of a single permanent establishment for tax purposes under the Treaty. There is no precedent for treating six branch offices as six separate permanent establishments in either the United States or in the United Kingdom. To the contrary, NatWest has presented the undisputed declaration of Mr. Jukes, who states that the Inland Revenue would have treated banking operations similar to NatWest\rquote s as a single permanent establishment, in the United Kingdom. Mr. Akin, the government\rquote s Inland Revenue expert, does not disagree. He indicated that Inland Revenue would have likely accepted an aggregated tax return.

Moreover, it is not disputed that the United States always treated the six branch offices as a single establishment for tax purposes. The government has not identified a single instance where any other foreign bank with more than one branch office has been treated as having more than one permanent establishment in the U.S. For all of these reasons, the court agrees with NatWest that as a matter of law NatWest operated a single permanent establishment in the United States and thus NatWest may account for capital and interest paid on capital contributions on an aggregated basis.

 Office to branches in the United States for the purchase of fixed assets or other start up expenses were separately identified in the books and records and recorded as a \u8220\'3fcapital loan.\u8221\'3f Scott Decl. \u182\'3f\u182\'3f 11\u8211\'3f12.

Where ... the loan is still funded by borrowing in the branch, it is generally not possible to argue that the interest expense thereon should not be relieved or should be deemed to belong to Head Office.

For all of these reasons, the government\rquote s objections to NatWest\rquote s capital analysis based on the losses generated by the Chicago branch office in 1981 and 1982 and various New York offices is rejected. NatWest\rquote s failure to account for losses does not preclude summary judgment for NatWest on the capital issue.

Finally, the government\rquote s third objection regarding fixed assets must be rejected. As discussed above, it is not disputed that capital infusions from the Head Office for premises and fixed assets as well as initial working capital were identified by NatWest\rquote s branches on their books. It is also not disputed that interest was not charged on these amounts. Nonetheless, the government contends that NatWest has failed to adequately consider all potential sources of capital. The government specifically challenges NatWest\rquote s failure to deduct additional interest to cover the amounts it repaid the Head Office on fixed assets and premises. The government argues that unless NatWest can trace the amounts it paid for fixed assets and premises to specific borrowings, the Manual presumes that the amounts will be treated as allotted capital and no interest may be deducted on those amounts.

{\b0 \cf19 \f2 \ul0 \strike0 \i0 \fs20 \sa0 \sb200 
 This is the item most commonly found in the calculation of free working capital. If premises are acquired when the branch is set up they are capital assets and prima facie where the funds came from Head Office it will be treated as allotted capital. The assumption that premises will be funded from capital is based primarily on examination of normal banking practice.

This is not a hard and fast rule, but it is up to the bank to show that the acquisition is not to be treated this way. The bank can do this by tracing the cost of the building through to a specific borrowing ... there will be an interest deduction due in the U.K. branch.

The court agrees with NatWest that no further interest deduction from profits is due in order to deal with interest payments on fixed assets. The undisputed facts establish that NatWest adopted a policy in 1977 that it would not fund fixed assets in its branches with interest-bearing obligations. Thus, it is not necessary to trace the amounts used to pay for fixed assets. NatWest allotted capital on the books and records of the branches for fixed assets and premises and the undisputed evidence establishes that NatWest did not pay interest on those amounts. In such circumstances, tracing assets is not required.

Moreover, the undisputed evidence establishes that the U.S. branch had sufficient interest-free cash flow to make payments to the Head Office for their fixed asset purchases during the years at issue. Mr. Bandoian\rquote s Report confirms Mr. Walmsley\rquote s statements that NatWest\rquote s U.S. branches had, in the aggregate, sufficient resources to cover their fixed asset purchases. For all of these reasons, NatWest is entitled to summary judgment on the capital issue.

 It is not disputed that NatWest\rquote s U.S. money market desks managed the banking assets and liabilities in the branches\rquote  balance sheet. As Mr. Scott Payseur, Senior Vice President of the Money Market\rquote s unit of NatWest, states in his declaration:

Over the course of each day, assets and liabilities changed as the branch made loans to customers, engaged in money market transactions to fund those loans, and engaged in transactions to manage risk and to make a profit. As the mix of assets and liabilities evolved, the money market desk managed the branch\rquote s interest rate and liquidity risk. Interest rate risk occurs due to a mismatch between maturities and rates of various assets and liabilities. Liquidity risk occurs when a bank does not have the funds, or is not able to raise funds at a reasonable cost, to cover obligations that come due.

Mr. Read challenges Dr. Clair\rquote s reliance on only twenty-one days of data and generally questions the adequacy of Dr. Clair\rquote s sample. Mr. Read also questions Dr. Clair\rquote s conclusions. Mr. Read states that Dr. Clair\rquote s conclusions are based only on the sample he selected and should not be extended further.

 The U.S. branches maintained dollar clearing accounts, much like checking accounts, for unrelated non-U.S. banks, non-U.S. branches of NatWest, NatWest\rquote s subsidiary International Westminster Bank and other NatWest affiliates. According to Mr. Walmsley:

The clearing accounts maintained by the U.S. branches enabled their non-U.S. counterparties [sic] to transact their business in dollars. It is inherent in the structure of financial markets that dollars never leave the United States, except in the form of coins or paper currency. Thus, transactions in dollars outside the United States are usually effected by means of transfer of dollars within the United States between U.S. banks (or U.S. branches of foreign banks) that have access to accounts at the Federal Reserve....

First, they charged virtually all customers-both related and unrelated-a standard fixed per-transaction commission .... Second, when a customer used a clearing account to make a payment, a positive balance often sat in the account until the payment instruction cleared and while the funds were sitting there, the balance could be used by the bank to fund short-term assets.

In response, the government has submitted the affidavit of Mr. Read. Mr. Read asserts, based on his review of three months of data, that the difference in interest rates between the U.S. branches and affiliates, related parties, and third parties could not be explained solely by differences in the volume of transactions, as NatWest contends. Instead, Mr. Read concluded that with respect to customers in the intermediate activity levels, affiliated and related parties were receiving better rates than similarly-situated third parties.

NatWest challenges Mr. Read\rquote s assertions through supplemental affidavits filed by Mr. Walmsley and Dr. Clair. Both Mr. Walmsley and Dr. Clair challenge Mr. Read\rquote s conclusions on the grounds that Mr. Read erroneously relied on data involving the account of NatWest Commercial Services, Inc., a NatWest affiliate. NatWest argues that the Commercial Services affiliate maintained a revolving loan account with the U.S. branches and thus the account was not a \u8220\'3fclearing account.\u8221\'3f Walmsley Supp. Decl. \u182\'3f\u182\'3f 3, 5; Clair Supp. Aff. \u182\'3f\u182\'3f 47\u8211\'3f52. NatWest also argues that affiliates are neither related parties nor third parties and thus should not be included in the analysis. They also question Mr. Read\rquote s conclusion, based on three months of data, that NatWest understated its clearing account profit by over $10 million. NatWest argues that Mr. Read\rquote s declaration does not suffice to defeat summary judgment.

The court agrees with the government that disputed issues of fact preclude an award of summary judgment to NatWest. Mr. Read\rquote s analysis and opinion create material issues of fact that cannot be resolved on summary judgment. In contrast to the government expert opinion regarding the money market transactions, Mr. Read\rquote s declaration offers a conclusion that NatWest understated its clearing account income by over $10 million and includes the factual basis and process of reasoning that support that conclusion.

At oral argument on December 9, 2005, the government clarified its argument with regard to \u8220\'3feconomic capital.\u8221\'3f In particular, the government explained that it does not seek to attribute a particular amount of \u8220\'3feconomic capital\u8221\'3f to NatWest\rquote s permanent establishment. Instead, the government argues that the Manual required NatWest\rquote s permanent establishment to operate as if it were wholly independent from the Head Office, which means that the permanent establishment was required to maintain a certain amount of \u8220\'3feconomic capital.\u8221\'3f Because NatWest did not do so, the government argues that NatWest will not be able to sustain its burden of proving that it overpaid its tax using the principles of the Manual. The court finds that this is a distinction without difference. Either way, the government\rquote s arguments boil down to an assertion that NatWest\rquote s permanent establishment was required to account for \u8220\'3feconomic capital\u8221\'3f in calculating profit in order to meet its burden in this case.

The government argues that Mr. Read was not able to perform a larger study because, (1) his report was due only 30 days after the close of discovery, (2) the cost of a full sampling study would be extremely high, and (3) the plaintiff was not relying on a sampling study to meet its burden of proof.

Although the court appreciates the difficulty of calculating the plaintiff\rquote s tax liability in this particular case, that does not change the fact that, as discussed below, the government has not set forth specific facts demonstrating a genuine issue for trial.
