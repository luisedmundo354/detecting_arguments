This is a lawsuit against the United States wherein the plaintiffs, James B. Dunigan and Sally I. Dunigan, in separate cases, seek a refund of about $30,000.00 of gift taxes plus interest. The government initially assessed the gift taxes on the plaintiffs\rquote  transfer of stocks to eight trusts, the beneficiaries of which are Mrs. Dunigan and the three children of Mr. Dunigan. The Court will refer to the pertinent transactions in more detail later. The plaintiffs paid the gift taxes and filed a claim for refund of such taxes. The claims were denied and the plaintiffs brought individual suits which were consolidated for this trial.

I wish to stress very strongly that this is not a criminal matter. There is no charge that anybody has committed a crime and no crime can grow out of these transactions regardless of the outcome of this case. As you heard from the argument, there is no crime in making an effort to avoid the payment of gift taxes or income taxes by any means the taxpayer believes are lawful. There is a crime when he attempts to evade the payment of taxes fraudulently, but there is no claim of fraud here. Even though a taxpayer attempts to avoid the payment of taxes by what he thinks are legitimate means, and even though he is successful, no crime can grow out of his actions. This is purely a civil action which involved only a difference of opinion between the plaintiffs and the government concerning whether gift taxes are owed by the plaintiffs.

 In this case the evidence shows as follows: on June 1, 1961, James B. Dunigan created five trusts for the benefit of his wife, Sally, and his three children. On the same day, James B. Dunigan and his wife, Sally, together, created three additional trusts for the children. At the same time, James B. Dunigan and Sally I. Dunigan made gifts to the trusts of property consisting of cash and other items worth about $11,000.00. The plaintiffs admit that the transfers in June, 1961 were gifts and so reported them.

Those are not the matters that you have under consideration here. You have heard them spoken of by the witnesses here as being something in addition to the later transfers on or about July 1, 1961, and they formed a part of the corpus of the trusts, but at any rate, those matters are not in issue in this case as there has been no difference of opinion about the fact that they were gifts and that gift taxes were owed and gift taxes had been paid on them. The transaction in question here is the one I am about to describe now.

On July 1, 1961, the plaintiffs transferred additional property to the trusts consisting of stocks in different companies controlled by the Dunigan family and worth about $643,000.00. In exchange, the trusts, through their trustees, executed annuity contracts promising to pay James B. Dunigan monthly amounts totaling $60,000.00 per year for the remainder of his life, in $5,000.00 monthly installments. It is the transfer of these stocks which is in issue.

That is, without getting something in return which is of substantially equal value. The plaintiffs also contend that the value of the annuity contracts from the trusts to James B.

The government contends that the most the annuity contracts were worth was $497,250.00 and, therefore, there was a gift of at least $145,696.00 by the plaintiffs to the trusts; that is, the value of the stocks transferred to the trusts in the amount of $642,946.00, less the value of the annuity contracts in the amount of $497,250.00.

You see from that that there is no difference of opinion between the government and the plaintiffs about the value of the stocks that were transferred to the trusts. As a matter of fact, it is stipulated by them that that value was $642,946.00. The difference of opinion between the government and the plaintiffs is over the value of the annuity contracts. The plaintiffs say that the value is at substantially the same and at least as much as the value of the stock transferred. The government says that the value of the annuity was only $497,250.00, which leaves a difference of $145,696.00 which must be considered as a gift. In other words, the government says that the trusts got that much more than the value they gave in return.

The gift tax applies to gifts of property even when the persons making the gifts receive something in exchange as consideration for the gifts; this happens when the value of the property given and the value of the consideration received in exchange do not balance. In such a case, the Court instructs you that the law presumes that there is a gift in the amount by which the value of the property given exceeds the consideration received in exchange.

The plaintiffs contend that the use of that table was arbitrary and unreasonable because it was a table that was created or made up in 1939, and that that table does not take into consideration the advancement of medical science, or the lengthening of life that has taken place since that time. In other words, they say, as stated in the argument, that it is outmoded and out-of-date. There was also testimony here to the effect that 3% interest rate should be used in single annuity transactions of this kind, whereas in this case the government used 3\u189\'3f%. That was the reason for the interrogation, you will remember, of the witnesses here about the 3% and 3\u189\'3f%. That occurred when Mr. Chamberlain was on the witness stand and Mr. Guild was cross examining him.

The government says that the use of that Table No. 1 was perfectly reasonable and proper. It is up to you to decide whether or not Table No. 1 worked up in 1939 and adopted for use for the purpose of determining the value of the annuities, taking into consideration life expectancy and the other factors that you heard from the testimony here, was reasonable in arriving at the life expectancy of Mr. Dunigan and the value of his annuity, and all the other factors in 1961. That would be a difference of about 42 years\u8211\'3fno, 22 years. I was thinking about 40 subtracted from 60. The difference is about 22 years. In that connection, you are instructed that when a government regulation is involved, it is presumed to be reasonable and the use of it is presumed to be reasonable. But those presumptions are what we call rebuttable presumptions. In other words, if they are offered in evidence and there is no credible evidence to the contrary, then we can accept them as reasonable and the use of them as reasonable. If there is evidence offered questioning the reasonableness of the table and the reasonableness of the use of it, then it is up to you to decide whether or not that evidence is sufficient to overcome the presumptions. In that connection, the burden of proof is on the plaintiffs to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that it was arbitrary and unreasonable and erroneous for the Commissioner of Internal Revenue to require the use of this Table No. 1 made up in 1939 in judging these transactions that took place in 1961.

The preamble to interrogatory No. 3 is: \u8220\'3fYou will answer Interrogatory No. 3 only in the event you have answered Interrogatory No. 2 \lquote Yes\rquote .\u8221\'3f Interrogatory No. 3 reads: \u8220\'3fDo you find from a preponderance of the evidence that the value of the private annuity contracts issued by the trusts to James B. Dunigan on July 1, 1961, was substantially equal in value to the securities which he transferred to such trust in exchange for the annuities?\u8221\'3f

Even though your * * * took into consideration that annuitants had a greater life expectancy back in 1939, it would still be based on longevity of people as of that time; and if the longevity of people generally has increased, the longevity of the preferred risk would increase.

MR.

The government further objects to the failure of the Court to give its requested charge concerning the purposes of Congress in enacting the gift tax. This constitutes defendant\rquote s requested instruction No. 9, starting with the second sentence, \u8220\'3fOne of the purposes of Congress in enacting the gift tax was to discourage family settlements which result in avoidance of estate taxes. Without this gift tax, a person might give away all or part of his property before his death to the natural objects of his bounty without subjecting the property to the taxes on estates. Also, Congress sought to discourage transfer of property which, in effect, result in the avoidance of the income tax on higher brackets of income\u8221\'3f, and the failure of the Court to so instruct the jury fails to apprise the jury of the significance of the evidence by the government and deprived them of a factor that they might consider in determining the true intent of Mr. Dunigan, which is the first issue in the special questions.
