Pursuant to a Purchase Agreement dated November 9, 1973, Federal Express sold 122,500 shares of Convertible Preferred Stock, $100 par value, and $12,250,000.00 principal amount of Subordinated Promissory Notes due October 1, 1981. In September 1974 plaintiff sold $3,876,000.00 principal amount of 8% Convertible Subordinated Promissory Notes due October 1, 1981. In its federal income tax return for the year ending May 31, 1976, the company deducted interest on both issues of subordinated promissory notes in the amount of $778,386.64. In its return for the subsequent year, plaintiff deducted $1,249,388.30 in interest on both issues, and for the year ending May 31, 1978, it deducted $1,220,438.03.

After auditing plaintiff\rquote s 1976, 1977, and 1978 corporate income tax returns, the Internal Revenue Service disallowed these interest deductions. The disallowance resulted in the reduction of plaintiff\rquote s net operating loss carry forward to 1978 and investment credit carry forward to 1979 and the assessment of additional taxes for both 1978 and 1979. On April 15, 1981, plaintiff filed a protest of the disallowance determination with the Internal Revenue Service Appeals Office in Nashville. After a hearing and correspondence between the parties, the IRS issued on September 27, 1982, a Notice of Deficiency, assessing a $387,839.96 deficiency for 1978 and a $1,171,303.02 deficiency for 1979.

{\b0 \cf19 \f2 \ul0 \strike0 \i0 \fs20 \sa0 \sb0 
 Plaintiff paid these deficiencies on October 1, 1982, and interest in the amounts of $179,474.27 on the 1978 deficiency and $471,746.30 on the 1979 deficiency on December 1, 1982. On October 18, 1982, plaintiff filed claims for refund of the deficiencies, and on December 23, 1982, the IRS disallowed the claims. Plaintiff filed this lawsuit on June 3, 1983, to recover the deficiencies and interest paid plus accrued statutory interest on these amounts.

Federal Express was incorporated on June 24, 1971. Its founder, president and chief operating officer throughout the pertinent time period was Frederick W. Smith. From the company\rquote s founding, Smith anticipated that it would be developed in three phases. The first phase encompassed three projects. The first was development of a prototype for an all-cargo airplane; the second was achieving a modification of Civil Aeronautics Board regulations to exempt small, all-cargo planes from economic regulations; the third was to determine the market feasibility of the Federal Express concept. After all three aspects of the first phase had been successfully completed, the company then entered its second development phase. During the second phase the company increased its fleet of all-cargo aircraft to ten planes acquired through a first mortgage financing. The company utilized these planes to perform charter cargo service for the United States Post Office and others. This enabled the company to begin to develop a source of operating revenues.

The third phase of development was the implementation of a national, overnight package delivery system utilizing thirty-three airplanes, ground transportation equipment, a sorting facility and miscellaneous support equipment. Smith knew from the beginning that this third phase development could not be accomplished without a substantial amount of external financing in the form of bank debt and venture capital.

In the fall of 1972 Federal Express hired the investment banking firm of White, Weld & Company to assist in obtaining the financing necessary to implement the nationwide package system. White, Weld was unsuccessful in its initial attempt to procure the necessary financing and in the summer of 1973 enlisted the aid of New Court Securities, Inc. White, Weld and New Court began at that time to assemble a group of institutional investors and commercial lenders to participate in the proposed Federal Express financing.

This loan was secured by a first mortgage on the aircraft as well as the guaranty of General Dynamics Corporation. The purchase increased the size of Federal Express\rquote s fleet of aircraft to the projected thirty-three.

Contemporaneously, Federal Express entered into a Credit Agreement with a consortium of banks and institutional lenders led by the Chase Manhattan Bank N.S. (Chase Group). Pursuant to the purchase agreement, Federal Express received $24,500,000. In exchange, Federal Express issued $12,250,000 of Class A and Class B Convertible Preferred Stock and $12,250,000 principal amount of Subordinated Promissory Notes due October 1, 1981. Each purchaser of a Note purchased shares of stock at $100 per share with a cost equal to the cost of the Note acquired.

The investment was structured in this fashion because the Investor Group was willing to invest only half of its funds as permanent equity capital. The Investor Group wanted the other half to be structured as debt to be repaid at a specific point in time, generating an acceptable rate of return in the interim. They anticipated that the debt half of their investment represented by the Notes could be serviced and repaid from cash flow generated by the company\rquote s operations. Despite the company\rquote s insolvency at the time of the financing, they believed that Federal Express could service and repay the debt to the Chase Group as well as the Notes. These expectations were based upon projections prepared by Federal Express, the study prepared by General Dynamics, market studies developed by A.T. Kearney & Co., Inc. and Aerospace Advance Planning Group and independent investigations conducted by Investor Group members.

Prior to November 1973 Federal Express had acquired all the equipment necessary to implement its nationwide package delivery service, including thirty-three Falcon Aircraft, ground transportation vehicles and a central sorting facility.

No interest was scheduled to be earned until the period beginning October 1, 1975. The payment of interest on the debt was subject to reduction based on a formula contained in the Purchase Agreement. The formula took into account the company\rquote s cash flow situation.

Various provisions of the Notes were included at the instigation of the interested parties for several reasons. Throughout negotiations between the Chase Group and the Investor Group, the Chase Group insisted on subordination of interest and principal on the Notes to its debt. The interest reduction formula was designed to protect the interest payments on the Chase Group debt and simultaneously to retain sufficient operating cash within the company. The Investor Group insisted on the prepayment provisions, the interest provisions, an absolute promise to repay by a date certain, and a provision that the debt would only be subordinate to bank debt, not trade creditors.

In September 1974 Federal Express entered into a Purchase Agreement with twenty entities, institutions and individuals. This group consisted of most of the purchasers of the 1973 Notes and one investor who had not participated in the 1973 financing. Pursuant to the terms and conditions contained in the Purchase Agreement, Federal Express issued $3,876,000 principal amount of 8% Convertible Subordinated Notes due October 1, 1981.

(1) The 1974 Notes contained a conversion feature that allowed a holder to convert the principal amount of its Note to Federal Express common stock at a very low conversion price. On an aggregate basis, those who participated in the September 1974 financing would, on conversion, receive a substantial percentage of Federal Express\rquote s equity, while prior investors who did not participate would have their equity position diluted significantly. This created an inducement to prior investors to participate in the September 1974 financing.

The participants in the September 1974 financing continued to believe that Federal Express would generate sufficient cash flow to service and repay all of its indebtedness, including the Chase Group debt and the 1973 and 1974 Notes. This belief was based not only upon the information that had been available prior to the 1973 financing, but also on Federal Express\rquote s operating history in the interim, particularly the continued growth of the number of packages handled per month.

Where the Commissioner has examined the returns and subjected them to a comprehensive investigation, however, a claim for refund seeking to recover the deficiencies in tax that he has determined to exist and that the taxpayer has paid need not be nearly as specific as otherwise would have been the case. Under these circumstances a refund claim is sufficient if it notifies the Commissioner that the taxpayer does not agree with the conclusions of law he has reached in his deficiency notice, the facts he considered in determining that the additional taxes were due, or facts that he naturally would have ascertained in the course of the investigation that led to his determination of the additional tax liability.

 the Commissioner raised no question about the form of the refund claim when it was filed with him. Defendant then for the first time argues that, when the District Director rejected Federal Express\rquote s claim in December 1982, his comment that the claim was \u8220\'3flegally insufficient\u8221\'3f referred to its form. Viewing defendant\rquote s argument most favorably, the court could perhaps conclude that the Director\rquote s statement was ambiguous because, standing alone, the statement fails to disclose the nature of the claim\rquote s inadequacy. Read less generously, however, the December disallowance letter plainly disposes of plaintiff\rquote s claim on the merits. This latter interpretation is certainly the most reasonable interpretation of the Director\rquote s letter. The December letter refers to the September 1982 Notice of Deficiency in which the IRS specifically determined that the Notes represented capital investment rather than debt. Moreover, the record, including plaintiff\rquote s exhaustive protest, indicates that the Director had access to detailed information concerning plaintiff\rquote s position on the merits when he issued the Notice of Deficiency.

 Exhibits 24 and 26. This information clearly and unambiguously discusses all arguments asserted by plaintiff here. Therefore, the court concludes that the disallowance goes to the merits of plaintiff\rquote s claim. The Commissioner understood the ground of plaintiff\rquote s claim and facts sufficient to determine its exact basis.

Defendant asserts that the investors who purchased the Notes in question advanced these funds contemporaneously with stock acquisition, that interest was not payable during the first year nor until after superior debt was paid, that interest was only payable out of earnings, that the debts were subordinated and unsecured, that no sinking fund was provided, and that plaintiff was insolvent through most of the time period during which the advances were made. From this defendant concludes that the advances were placed entirely at the risk of plaintiff\rquote s business.

Defendant never explicitly takes a position about the appropriate legal analysis for this case. It does, however, make several arguments. It maintains that the instruments on their faces do not constitute loans and that the court should not look beyond the instruments to the intent of the parties. Then it contends that the transactions did not embody unconditional rights to repayment. It also asserts that subordination of debt weighs heavily toward a finding of equity participation.

The court gives no weight to the one-year deferral in interest payments. As long as it does not affect the ultimate adequacy of the interest, an argument defendant does not make, this timing of the payments does not alter the underlying obligation to pay. Similarly, while the Notes provide for deferral of the payment of interest until after payment of superior indebtedness, this deferral does not affect the accrual of that interest; in terms of the obligation to repay, it would seem that the obligation turns on accrual. Finally, the Notes\rquote  allocation of interest out of net income does not create a contingency in the obligation to repay, but, as with the other terms, merely affects the timing of the repayments.

This position, which seems to fly in the face of defendant\rquote s insistence that this court limit its inquiry to the instruments themselves, does not alter the court\rquote s conclusion that the Notes represent debt.

Second, plaintiff presents a wealth of proof indicating the potential for success of a national, overnight package delivery system and the continually increasing business volume of Federal Express at the time the loans were made. Defendant does not contradict this evidence but rather asks the court to ignore it and look instead to the fact that the corporation\rquote s liabilities exceeded its assets at a particular point in time.

{\b0 \cf19 \f2 \ul0 \strike0 \i0 \fs20 \sa0 \sb0 
 Indeed, by comparing Federal Express to Scriptomatic, defendant implicitly suggests that only loans to companies with a \u8220\'3fminimal risk of failure\u8221\'3f and a \u8220\'3fsolid background in [their] field[s] of endeavor\u8221\'3f constitute unconditional obligations to repay. Defendant\rquote s Post-Trial Memorandum, pp. 7\u8211\'3f8. The court disagrees. Although Federal Express\rquote  success was by no means certain at the time the Notes were executed, uncontroverted evidence establishes that the company nevertheless undertook an unconditional obligation to repay these loans.

At trial the court admitted Exhibits 1\u8211\'3f23 into evidence and marked Exhibits 24\u8211\'3f26 for identification. Trial Transcript at 108. [hereinafter cited as Tr. \u8211\'3f\u8211\'3f\u8211\'3f.] Exhibit 24 consists of correspondence between the parties; Exhibit 25 is the District Director\rquote s examination report; and Exhibit 26 is the protest plaintiff filed with the District Director. Defendant objected to the admission of these three exhibits, arguing that they lacked relevance. Tr. 107. Defendant essentially maintained that, in evaluating the scope of the Commissioner\rquote s notice of plaintiff\rquote s basis for its refund claim, the court could not look at events that occurred prior to plaintiff\rquote s submission of the claim for refund. At that time the court deferred a ruling on this matter. Tr. 107\u8211\'3f08. The court now determines that these documents are relevant for two purposes and admits them into evidence. First, Exhibits 24\u8211\'3f26 are relevant in determining the sufficiency of the refund claim if the

The court upheld the district court\rquote s decision to entertain the taxpayer\rquote s arguments that it never received the commission attributed to it and that it was not licensed to receive commissions but reversed the decision that the direct recipients of the commissions were not owned or controlled by the same interest or that redistribution of income did not clearly reflect the income of the taxpayer and other affected parties.

Even under a factors analysis, the 1973 and 1974 Notes represent debt. When a factors analysis applies, the court must weigh the various factors appropriately, given the facts and circumstances of the particular transaction. Such weighing compels the finding here that the Notes represent debt in form and substance.

Similarly, defendant\rquote s argument that plaintiff\rquote s debt was unsecured fails. Debt simply does not become equity for want of security. Likewise, the absence of a sinking fund is not dispositive.

The court has already dealt with the adequacy of the interest rate and the subordination of the Notes. Defendant does, however, state a new position. It argues that the Notes subordinated the noteholders\rquote  debt to all present and future debt. Defendant provides no support for this assertion, and the court rejects it, reading the subordination provisions in the purchase agreements to subordinate the Notes only to present and future debt which is \u8220\'3fsubordinate or junior in any respect to other indebtedness of the Company....\u8221\'3f Exhibit 2, at 20; Exhibit 4, at 40.
