Therefore, the result was that Plaintiff conveyed certain rights to Phillips and Cofra Black while retaining the use of parallel patents for its affiliated companies which competed with Cofra Black and which earned substantial profits for Plaintiff. The question to be answered under these facts is whether or not Plaintiff is eligible for capital gains treatment on income received as a direct result of the licensing of patent rights to Phillips and Cofra Black. In order to be so eligible, it must be found that Plaintiff transferred substantially all of its rights under the patents in question in order that the transfer or sale of a capital asset be deemed to have occurred. Plaintiff claims that it comes within this requirement and Defendant claims that Plaintiff retained and exercised sufficient rights to preclude capital gains treatment.

In transferring the patent rights, Plaintiff retained two substantial rights: the right to use and the right to sell products manufactured pursuant to patents parallel to those granted to Cofra Black. The retention of these rights precludes Plaintiff from enjoying capital gains treatment for the income in question. The substantiality of these two rights is evidenced by the volume of sales of Plaintiff\rquote s affiliated companies, and the profits realized by Plaintiff. Plaintiff\rquote s Dutch affiliate competed with Cofra Black using parallel non-French patents and consummates sales of just under $1,000,000.00. Ex-20. While no other figures were put into evidence, it is the opinion of this Court that from the evidence presented, it is apparent that Plaintiff did retain substantial rights in the patents in question. It also appears that Plaintiff was aware of the profit potential of at least its Dutch affiliate in view of the terms of the PAtent Transfer Agreement. Ex. 18.

The Court accepts Defendant\rquote s position on this question and is of the opinion that Defendant should prevail on this issue as well.
