This is what we call a civil suit, in contrast to that which is referred to as a criminal case. In this case the plaintiff seeks a refund of taxes paid by it to the United States. This case does not involve any criminal violations or criminal prosecutions or allegations that a crime has been committed. In other words, there has not been any charge of criminality so far as this matter is concerned.

This case comes before you in this way: The plaintiff claims certain income tax deductions on the forms that it filed for the years in question. Nevertheless, it paid the amounts which the government intends were due when the government disallowed the deductions that had been claimed. Having paid the disputed amounts the plaintiff now brings this suit to recover the sums in controversy.

Now, I think there are several introductory remarks that would be in order so far as the general principles of law in a case of this type. First of all, there is nothing at all wrong with taking an income tax deduction which the law allows. This is true of you and me as individuals. For example, I may rent a house, next door you might live and you might own the house and might have a mortgage at the bank. I might have to pay a certain amount of money each month as rent. You might have to pay exactly the same amount as interest on your mortgage. So far as you are concerned you can deduct for federal income tax purposes the interest that you would pay on your mortgage. So far as I am concerned I could not deduct the amount which I pay as rent. Now, there is nothing illegal or improper or unfair about your taking that deduction even though in the dollar amount it is exactly the same as the dollar amount which I can\rquote t take because I am paying rent and you are paying interest.

{\b0 \cf19 \f2 \ul0 \strike0 \i0 \fs20 \sa0 \sb0 
Now, what is true of individuals is also true of corporations. A corporation can take a deduction to which it is entitled. It can\rquote t take any more but it certainly is entitled to take all that the law allows. Bear in mind that there is nothing wrong at all with framing a decision that you make with the tax consequence in mind in deciding what you are going to do to take advantage of the deductions which the law allows. For example, you might decide that it would be to your best interest for income tax purposes to make a payment of interest on December 31 of 1973 so that you could include it as a deduction for the year 1973 rather than paying it on January 1, 1974. You would be making a business decision based upon tax consequences. There is nothing at all wrong with doing that. You can decide this with a tax consequence in mind and you can make a decision so that you can take advantage of the deductions which the law allows.

{\b0 \cf19 \f2 \ul0 \strike0 \i0 \fs20 \sa0 \sb0 
 In other words, the law does not suggest or say that people who make business decisions have to sit in a big dark fog unaware of the fact that whatever they do may be subject to certain tax consequences.

Now, bear in mind I am not saying that they can make a deal appear to be one thing so that they can take advantage of taxes, the tax consequences when actually it is something else. It is the substance and not the form which governs. For example, I couldn\rquote t, when I pay my rent to my landlord, in the hypothetical I just suggested to you, I can\rquote t write the check to interest and he can\rquote t, to accommodate me, say, \u8220\'3fWell, this is interest.\u8221\'3f When he receives my money and gives me a receipt he can\rquote t say interest, and I can\rquote t say interest if, in fact, I am paying him rent. We can\rquote t make the form appear to be one thing if the substance is something else.

On the other hand, when I am deciding whether or not I would rather buy a house or rent there is nothing at all wrong with my saying: Well, if I rent that house I can\rquote t take those amounts I have to pay each month as a deduction. But if I buy the house and have to pay interest on the mortgage, then my mortgage interest would be deductible for federal income tax purposes and therefore I think I will buy the house. There is nothing at all wrong with making a decision when the tax consequence is involved. But I say you can\rquote t dress it up to be one thing if it is in fact something else of which you can take advantage of tax deduction.

The second thing that I want you to be aware of is the fact that the United States is involved in this case and that doesn\rquote t make a bit of difference so far as your deliberations are concerned.

You would be unpatriotic if there was a decision against a litigant just because the United States was on the other side.

Now, bear in mind what I have previously told you about certain charts which were introduced by the government in this case. These reflect the government\rquote s arguments. They are a summary of certain contentions which the defendant has made. Well, certain things which the defendant contends are true. Now, whether or not those things are true, whether or not they are particularly significant is for you to decide. But as I told you before, those charts reflect an argument, a contention rather than that which you must accept as an actuality. I am certainly not suggesting that they are not material. I am certainly not suggesting that the contention is not a valid contention, but it is a contention and it doesn\rquote t become a fact, have any significance until you find it to be of significance and until you find the chart to reflect the facts which they purport to represent.

This could be done if it was done when the obligation to that creditor is incurred.

It makes a similar contention so far as its Series B Debentures are concerned, the debentures that were issued in 1965. The defendant contends that the plaintiff may not take these deductions.

This problem of classifying investments as debt or equity for tax purposes arises with respect to obligations of a corporation where what the corporation owes to someone else may either be true debt or really part of the ownership. That is the equity of the corporation. If money advanced to a corporation is debt, the corporation is entitled to a deduction for the interest paid thereon and the repayment of the amount advanced is not taxable to the person receiving the repayment. On the other hand, if the advance as equity interest payments is really dividends so that the corporation is not entitled to an interest deduction and a repayment of advance is generally taxable to the recipient as ordinary income to the extent that the corporation has uninterested earnings and profits.

 What is a debt? A debt is an unconditional and legally enforceable obligation to repay a sum of money on a fixed or determinable date. It is the result of a loan. There is also an unconditional and legally enforceable obligation to pay interest at a fixed rate. It is a characteristic of debt that the interest is payable without regard to whether or not the debtor has profits with which to pay it.

An equity interest in the corporation is really part of ownership. Generally, there is no duty on the corporation to repay the amount paid for that interest and on liquidation of the corporation the owner of that type of interest participates in the distribution of assets only after all debts of the corporation have been paid. Equity is investment in the corporation which takes the risks of the venture and enjoys the future profits and earnings of that venture.

Usually common stock has voting rights. By that I mean the owners of the common stock have a right to vote for corporate directors and for changes in documents which the charter of the corporation or the by-laws of the corporation, certain fundamental documents which relate to the way the corporation does business and certain other things. In other words, one of the characteristics of common stock is the right to vote at a shareholders\rquote  meeting. Another characteristic is the right to share in the profits of the company. However, the holders of common stock have an inferior position so far as a share in the corporate assets are concerned if the corporation is dissolved and if its assets are liquidated, which means if they are sold for cash.

What about preferred stock? Well, in most instances preferred stock does not have the right to vote. Secondly, its shares of the profits may be limited. However, so far as profits are concerned it may also have a priority position and may have certain cumulative features year by year. For example, common stock may be a 7 percent common stock. If there were dividends in the corporation which would amount to 10 percent, the preferred stock would get its 7 percent return. It wouldn\rquote t get 8 percent, it wouldn\rquote t get 10 percent. It would get 7 percent because that is the amount of its preference. But suppose that there was only 7 percent or suppose that there was less than 7 percent. So that if you paid the preferred stock in full the common stock would get nothing.

If it can\rquote t pay the 7 percent in one year and if there is a cumulative feature involved, the corporation would be obligated to make up the difference in the following year. Well, the year after that. So the preferred stock may have its cumulative feature. Preferred stock may also have a superior position to common stock if the corporation has to be dissolved and the assets sold. Preferred stock may exist for the life of the company but frequently has a shorter life.

{\b0 \cf19 \f2 \ul0 \strike0 \i0 \fs20 \sa0 \sb0 
 In many situations a preferred stock has a period during which it can be redeemed or called or retired. The payment of a certain sum of money by the corporation can result in the preferred stock being turned in. Sometimes it can be exchanged for common stock.

Common stock has an unlimited right to share in the profits, if there are any profits. Preferred stock has the right to share in the profits, but its right is limited, although it is superior. Preferred stock has a higher priority on the liquidation where common stock has the lowest priority on liquidation. Common stock usually lasts for the corporate life. Preferred stock may be retired, but that is not always so.

Now, there can be all sorts of varieties and kinds of stock and one may have characteristics of preferred and some characteristics of common. In addition there may be a fine line between preferred stock issued by a corporation, in other words what we call equity, and a promise to repay a loan, that which we have been referring to as debt. In other words, both may have a right on the dissolution of the corporation and its subsequent liquidation to a priority over its interest. Both may be without the right to vote. There may be a fixed return which is expressed in some sort of a percentage. Although the preferred stock would only be entitled to that percentage in the event that there is a profit, while the holder of a debt obligation is entitled to interest whether or not there is a profit. And both preferred and a debt instrument may have some date when payment is called for, either some date which is directly set or when some date can be ascertained by the happening of an event or a series of events.

In general, the essential difference between a stockholder or one who makes an investment in capital, what we have been referring to as one who makes an investment in equity and one who loans money to a corporation, is that the stockholder\rquote s intention is to embark upon the corporate venture, taking the risk of the loss attendant upon it so that he may enjoy the chance of profit. The creditor, on the other hand, what we have been referring to as debt, does not intend to take such risk so far as they may be avoided, but merely intends to lend his money to those who are willing to take the risks.

In this case, the plaintiff\rquote s original debentures were in the form of debt and not equity. In other words, on its face these were debt instruments. This is also true of the Series B Debentures. The principal amount of these debentures was payable on January 15, 1973. Interest at 7 percent was payable semi-annually without regard to the earnings of the plaintiff and on liquidation they were entitled to participate in the distribution of assets equally with general creditors, which could include trade creditors if such creditors had been given a superior position as was permitted by the definition of superior indebtedness contained in the debenture itself. This distribution to the holders of the debenture would be prior to any distribution to the ownership interest in the plaintiff. Thus, in form and appearance the debentures were debt instruments.

Additionally, the parties treated the debenture as debt and not equity. The debentures were subordinated only to the plaintiff\rquote s bank loans and to its obligation to the Fischer Machine Company pursuant to the purchase agreement between Fischer and Scriptomatic. The 7 percent payment per annum required by the wording of the debenture was paid when due, and the principal amount required by the wording of the debenture was repaid prior to the maturity date and repayment prior to the maturity date does not mean that they did not comply with the requirements of the debentures.

Now, if this was all that was involved in this case we would not have any issue to submit to you. Your inquiry, however, does not stop there. Even if a corporation creates an obligation in the form of a debt and even if the parties thereafter treat it as a debt there are nevertheless circumstances in which the law disregards what the parties have done and for federal income tax purposes treats the debt as though it were equity. This occurs when the relationship between the owners of the corporation and the persons advancing the money is so close that the parties are able to fashion the transaction to suit their own purposes and the transaction because of this does not take the form which the economic realities of the situation indicate that it should take.

 The mere fact that money is advanced to the corporation by a shareholer, even if it was the only shareholder that the corporation had, does not automatically make that which is a loan an equity investment for federal tax purposes. Even a sole shareholder may loan money to his corporation and have it treated as debt. In other words, identity of ownership does not of itself prevent an advance from being treated as an indebtedness. However, identity of ownership is one of the factors to be considered in assessing the true nature of the transaction. Where those who advance money to the corporation were also its promoters, its entrepreneurs and its managers or where those who are stockholders are also creditors in the same relative portions, the transaction may be subject to close scrutiny. However, this does not necessarily preclude treating the transaction as a valid indebtedness.

}
{\b0 \cf19 \f2 \ul0 \strike0 \i0 \fs20 \sa0 \sb0 
 In other words, one who had purchased the package of stock and debentures could have sold the debentures and kept the stock if he wanted to do so or he could have sold them both or he could have sold the stock and kept the debentures. In other words, there is no requirement that once you acquire the package you had to hang onto it. You could sell part of it, you could sell it all, you could give it away, you could give part of it away. So there was no requirement that you keep whatever it was that you had bought. Thus, you may find that the right of free transferability dispels the limit of proportional control leaving the mere identity of ownership as only one factor to be weighed in answering the questions involved in this case.

Secondly, as I recall it, not all of those who advanced money participated in the management except perhaps to vote for directors or to otherwise cast their votes at shareholders\rquote  meetings and that would not really be participation in management, as I am considering it here.

 Well, now all of those persons who were first of all the Executive Committee and all those persons who were on the Board of Directors were stockholders and debenture holders, and the greater portion of the ownership, as I recall it, was concentrated in those persons who were on the Board and that is nothing either unusual or illegal. If a man owns a substantial block of stock he may think that he is the best person to decide how the ownership of the company is to be operated and what is to happen so far as the running of the business is concerned. As I indicated to you before, I have ruled that in form debentures in this case are debt instruments. In other words, that on their face they create the relationship of debtor and creditor. Saying the same thing another way, that money paid to the company for which the debenture was issued was a loan. As I have said, this is what the instrument provides on its face.

However, as you have been told, as I repeat now, you must look beyond the literal terms in which the parties cast the transaction in order to determine its substantive nature. You should also be aware that the parties involved in the affairs of this corporation did not attempt to do anything to vary the terms of the instruments. In other words, they did not use the instruments in any way that were different from the provisions of the instruments involved. For example, the return of 7 percent provided in the debenture was payable when due on each occasion, and there was no consideration of postponing or a request that it be postponed or any attempt to postpone it.

{\b0 \cf19 \f2 \ul0 \strike0 \i0 \fs20 \sa0 \sb0

 transaction. What does that mean? Well, simply stated it is a transaction which takes place when there is a diversity of interest where there is a countervailing pull on both sides of the bargaining table. It is a transaction which results from opposing pressures and opposing strengths and opposing needs. For example, suppose I want to buy a new car. Well, I go down to my favorite Plymouth dealer and I say, \u8220\'3fMike, I want to buy a new car.\u8221\'3f And he says, \u8220\'3fWell, I have a very fine eight cylinder Chrysler here. It has a 420 horsepower motor and it has power brakes and power steering, it weighs four tons, and it is just the greatest car in the world and I am willing to let you have it for $2,000.\u8221\'3f

The first question which you will be asked to decide is whether or not the interests and relationships of the persons who acquired the debentures and stock in this case were sufficiently varied and diverse so that the holders of the debentures on the one side and the plaintiff corporation and those who were to own and control it on the other side were diverse and varied.

 relationship between the corporation and a shareholder who supplies funds to it inevitably results in a transaction whose form mirrors its substance. Where the corporation is closely held, however, and the same persons occupy both sides of the bargaining table, form does not necessarily correspond to the intrinsic economic nature of the transaction, for the parties may hold it at their will with no countervailing pull. This is particularly so where a shareholder can have the funds he advances to a corporation treated as corporate obligations instead of contributions to capital without affecting his proportionate equity interest. Labels, which are perhaps the best in normal circumstances expressions of subjective intentions, thus lose their meaning.

 And in deciding whether or not there were sufficiently different interests in this case you should consider the identity of the interests of the debenture holders and the interests of the shareholders. In cases in which money is advanced to a corporation by shareholders and precisely the same proportions as their stock ownership, they may have a common interest to treat more of their advances as debt than the economic realities of the situation were otherwise justified. On the other hand, when a person is making advances on no stock in and are unrelated to the owners of the corporation, the form of the transaction generally reflects the true substance and the advances in the form of debt, it will be so treated.

 shares of stock for each $1,000 of consideration. You should consider how the group which acquired the original debentures which included these men was assembled. In other words, how did they get together? How did they meet? How close was the relationship among them? You should consider whether the group that made the decisions as to the management of the plaintiff had identical or substantially similar interests to those who acquired the debentures but were not included in direct management. You should consider who constituted the actual managers of the plaintiff and who constituted the Board of Directors. You should consider any other factors which you considered to be relevant in deciding whether the identity of the interests of the debenture holders and the interests of the shareholders was so close that they could mold the transaction to suit their common purposes.

Further, the extent of the actual participation by the debenture holders in the management of the plaintiff should be considered by you. The evidence shows that the actual managers in the business, at least as I recall it, were Leonard and Kooch. The Board of Directors consisted of those two plus Lang and Mann and Merton. No other debenture holders participated in managing except to vote his shares at the annual meeting.

Now, the very fact that I refer to some of the evidence doesn\rquote t mean that it is necessarily to be considered by you as more important than other evidence. I might go three or four times over something which you will think is absolutely trivial, it has nothing to do with the case, you can\rquote t understand why I keep harping on it.

Now, insofar as the transaction, the basic original debenture was concerned, it is my recollection of the testimony, but again I remind you that it is for you to determine what was said, there was testimony that there was conversation, and which I think Mr. Leonard said he was a participant and that certain things were discussed in his presence about what would be fair and what would be attractive, what would make people want to invest in this corporation, how high should the percentage be, should it be this high or higher.

To determine that question you must decide whether the transaction reflected economic realities of the situation. In this regard it is useful to consider the form the transaction would have taken had it been between the corporation and outside parties. If an outsider would have been willing to lend money to the corporation on the same terms and conditions you could conclude that the advances are true loans. If an outsider would not have loaned money to the corporation, on that basis you could conclude that the advances should be treated as equity. Thus, if you conclude that outsiders would have been willing to lend $525,000 to the plaintiff in January of 1963 on the basis of the original debentures and the accompanying stock, you could conclude the original debentures were true debt.

Well, one of the factors is a degree of risk involved in the venture and the ability of Scriptomatic to repay the amount which it on the face of the instrument agreed to repay. Now, most loans involve some degree of risk so that the mere existence of some risk on the part of a lender does not qualify that which is in form a debt as being equity. There are many instances in which the rate of interest on money borrowed clearly as loans varies depending upon the credit rating or the risk involved.
}
{\b0 \cf19 \f2 \ul0 \strike0 \i0 \fs20 \sa0 \sb0 
 When the degree of risk becomes so great that outside persons will refuse to lend money at all, then the advance must be considered as equity and not debt. One who lends money expects that the principal amount of the loan will be repaid and that the risk with respect to repayment are not unreasonable in light of the return for the interest on his loan.

{\b0 \cf19 \f2 \ul0 \strike0 \i0 \fs20 \sa0 \sb0 
A shareholder takes a greater risk with his capital with his investment in the expectation that he will realize the profits from the venture. The question you should consider is whether the risk that the principal of the original debentures would be repaid at their maturity were larger than those an outside creditor would have taken in return for the stock and interest paid so that the debentures should be really considered as part of the plaintiff\rquote s capital. It is basic for you in determining whether this is debt or equity to consider the risks.

{\b0 \cf19 \f2 \ul0 \strike0 \i0 \fs20 \sa0 \sb0 
 Another factor which relates is the timing of the advance with reference to the organization of the corporation. When the advance is made, at that time a corporation is formed and its business is wholly untried, there may be much greater uncertainty and risk than would be the case of an advance to an established business which has a prior record of achievement, permitting a reasonable appraisal of future prospects.

In this case the advance for which the original debentures were issued was made at a time when the plaintiff was first organized for business. It was going forth on a new venture. It was going forth with a new type of machine. However, you should bear this in mind: The business itself had been operating for a number of years under the direct guidance of Leonard and Kooch. They were the ones that continued to guide the business, and that it was being operated from approximately the same location. Thus, while there was a new corporation, it was not completely untried or inexperienced so far as its particular venture was concerned. It was to continue with the same management and with essentially the same assets, albeit with a new and untried product in a market which was perhaps known to it and in which it had had some experience but which was to a degree also untried and unknown.

The new machine, on the other hand, was to be sold through many dealers and was a less expensive machine, selling for, I believe a thousand or $1,500 or $2,000. At least substantially less than the older type of machine. So that there was a change in the way the machine was to be sold and the type of marketing requirements of the machine.

Another factor closely related to the matter of risk was the use to which the proceeds of the advances were to be put.
}
{\b0 \cf19 \f2 \ul0 \strike0 \i0 \fs20 \sa0 \sb0 
 The advances were to be used for buying capital assets, such as a building and machinery. This tends to suggest an investment in capital rather than a loan. Capital assets such as building and plant equipment very often do not on liquidation produce the cost expended to erect and, thus, the repayment of the advance for these purposes is generally dependent upon the future success of the business. If advances were for working capital this tends to suggest that this original debenture was loans. If the Series B Debentures were for working capital that would suggest they were for a loan. On the other hand, if the Series B Debentures were for what we might refer to as fixed assets, such as building, machinery, it would suggest the more likelihood that they were equity. Thus, the purpose of the advances must be considered by you in determining whether or not a particular advance was for capital or for debt.

Working capital includes such things as accounts receivables, inventory, working processes. In other words, assets that may be more readily, more quickly converted into cash and therefore under normal circumstances provide a greater assurance for the repayment of the loan.

As I recall the testimony, it showed that the fixed capital assets of the plaintiff were acquired from Fischer for between 45 and $50,000 and that $51,500 was set up on the books as representing that amount which would be equity from the amounts that were received from the sale of the debentures and the shares of stock that accompanied those debentures. You can consider the actual value of the assets and not solely the amount that was paid for them. These assets were acquired at the book value as shown on Fischer\rquote s books.

Well, it has been argued to you that some of these assets may have been worth a great deal more than the book value, as reflected on Fischer\rquote s books. You will have to consider whether or not that is true or what significance that has, if any. You will have to bear in mind that some of the assets were acquired in return for notes which were payable over a two-year period of time. What effect it may have.

Another factor that is closely related to risk is the ratio of the corporation\rquote s debt to its capital. In this case the plaintiff was organized with about $51,500 in capital. The indebtednes was shown to be $525,000. Thus, the debt was slightly more than 10 times the amount of capital.

You should consider whether in light of the nature of the plaintiff\rquote s business the amounts required for its capital assets, working capital, the plaintiff was inadequately capitalized so that outsiders would have not been willing to lend money on the original debentures. In this regard you should bear in mind that not all assets by a corporation will ordinarily be sold for their cost upon liquidation. Thus, the degree of risk so far as any particular loan is concerned varies in accordance with the investments which are superior to that loan or to that investment. The more debt that have a priority to be repaid in full from the assets of a corporation is the greater the risks involved so far as a lower investment is concerned because it just may not be enough assets available for the repayment if liquidation becomes necessary. However, you should also remember that some assets may bring more than their cost figures. Some things go up in value because of inflation or otherwise.

Now, another factor to be considered in assessing the risks in this case is the rights granted in the instrument itself.
}
{\b0 \cf19 \f2 \ul0 \strike0 \i0 \fs20 \sa0 \sb0 
 While the real facts and not the label controls the issue of whether an advance constitutes debt or equity, the rights stated in the instrument may be considered in determining what the risks are. One element, of course, is whether the instrument establishes a right to be paid out of specific assets. For example, through the enforced sale of a machine or some other assets. For example, you buy a car, you may have a lien put on your car. The person who has loaned you the money for the car may have a right to take the car and sell it. He doesn\rquote t have to take a position of a general creditor. The instrument creating the debt may give him the right to take the car. That\rquote s what we are talking about. We are talking about the rights that may be granted by an instrument.

THE COURT: When we took our recess I was discussing with you the factors which should be considered in evaluating the investment which is the subject of our consideration, and I had mentioned that the risk was one of the factors and a very important factor and some of the things that had to be considered when considering what we mean by risks.

{\b0 \cf19 \f2 \ul0 \strike0 \i0 \fs20 \sa0 \sb0 
Another factor that must be considered in weighing risk is the extent to which the rights of the holders of an instrument are subordinated to other persons advancing money to a corporation. This may be an important element in determining the risks that the investor takes. This follows because if the rights of a holder can be subordinated to other claims on the failure of the corporation, such other claims will be given a more preferential treatment than the holder of the instrument in question. Thus, the greater the rights of the corporation to subordinate, the greater the risk if liquidation becomes necessary to the holder of an instrument.

{\b0 \cf19 \f2 \ul0 \strike0 \i0 \fs20 \sa0 \sb0 
Here, the subordination agreement provided that if a corporation took certain affirmative action at an appropriate time the holder of the debenture would be relegated to a lower position on liquidation than any other creditor. It also provided that as to bank loans and as to the acquisition of property and assets the debenture would take an inferior position. So the result was that if money was borrowed from banks or other institutions or it was intended to refer to the acquisition to Fischer, although it certainly may have been broader than acquisitions from Fischer, but if there were acquisitions of what is referred to as property and as assets that the debenture was inferior to debt created in that respect.

Finally, there was the provision that if the corporation wished to make the debenture inferior to even a trade creditor, somebody who might come in and sell a box of pencils. In other words, if somebody did come in and sell a box of pencils on the contract of purchase, there was the appropriate notation made, and by appropriate notation there would have to be appropriate corporate action, but if everything was done appropriately, the man that sells a box of pencils could have been given a superior position on liquidation to the debentures about which we have been speaking.
}
{\b0 \cf19 \f2 \ul0 \strike0 \i0 \fs20 \sa0 \sb0 
 However, the fact that these debentures are subordinated to some corporate debts and could have been subordinated to any other, this fact is not determinative of the issues in this case. Where the equity is substantial, where the business prospects are such that there is a reasonable prospect of repayment, subordination is not conclusive.

{\b0 \cf19 \f2 \ul0 \strike0 \i0 \fs20 \sa0 \sb0 
 Remember that subordination only becomes important if the corporation has to liquidate to provide the fund for the repayment of an investment. If an investor is confident that it will never occur, the risk may still be there but if he is confident that there will be no liquidation, that liquidation will never be necessary because of the corporation\rquote s strength, the matter of subordination may be considered not to be a conclusive factor.

I have discussed with you several factors which you may consider in determining the true nature of the investments referred to in this case. Bear in mind that these factors, the degree of risk, the time when the advances were made, the use to which the money was put, the rate of the ratio of the corporation\rquote s debt to its capital and the matter of subordination are only aids in answering the ultimate question as to whether the investment analyzed in the terms of economic reality constitutes X equity or constitutes debt. In other words, no specific criteria or any series of criteria can provide a conclusive answer to the second question which will be submitted to you. Thus, you must take these factors as they relate to risks, evaluate them, and weigh them and use them in determining whether or not the investment here constitutes debt or equity.

The defendant contends that the debentures here were not a debt instrument at all but that these were legally preferred stock instruments and in furtherance of this argument the defendant suggests that the many similarities which the defendant says exists so far as preferred stock and these debentures were concerned.

That Section 1.07, it does not cover trade debts or some equivalent phrase, which is one of the contentions. I am not sure that that was covered later in the charge, but that is one thing that I call the Court\rquote s attention to, that I did not think that the Court\rquote s interpretation of C was mentioned.

You were describing the similarities, differences between common and preferred stock and I think in that description was missing, as far as preferred stock, what I would consider to be its most significant feature that respects in cases; that is, its complete subordination to all debt of the corporation, and that is a factor which I think in this context needs to be brought to their attention in light of the contention that this really is a preferred stock instrument.

MR. MULLARKEY: First of all, Your Honor, we object to the entirety, actually, of the instruction on diversity of interest. At least under the defendant\rquote s view the question here is whether under the economic realities of this case and the terms of the debentures in issuing the debentures management gave up anything of substance that it would have had if preferred stock had been issued, and contrarywise if under the facts of the case, again in accepting the debentures, the preferred equity holders received anything of substance that they would not have received had they received preferred stock.

{\b0 \cf19 \f2 \ri0 \i0 \qj \fs20 \li0 
{\b0 \cf19 \f2 \ul0 \strike0 \i0 \fs20 \sa0 \sb0 
I think contrarywise it should be pointed out that the real question is that under the economic realities of this case did the management of the corporation and holders of the instrument have such a common interest in labeling the preferred interest a debenture rather than preferred stock that the fact that it was cast in the form of debenture does not aid in determining whether the form mirrors the substance.

MR. MULLARKEY: Again, Your Honor, we believe that the fact that in determining if there was going to be a priority interest, it appears it may have been diverse is irrelevant in determining once a priority interest was going to be had it should be called debenture or preferred stock, because at that point the fact is that management might have been different.

MR.

It could well be that this company could have been highly profitable and yet in its best interest to postpone the payment of interest, because if they postponed the payment of interest perhaps they wouldn\rquote t have had to try to get more working capital. They could have solved some of their financial problems by the postponement of interest. Now, there was no testimony either way as far as I can recall in that regard.

It is labeled a loan.

I think that was the point where you clarified what I first brought up where you made reference only to D clause of 1.07. At that point I think that is the place where the clarification came that under the instrument as drawn trade creditors were not superior, and that was the charge, as I think was appropriate, in light of what Your Honor has indicated as to the construction of the instrument.

In discussing some of the attributes or characteristics of preferred stock I may have overlooked one that is important. Remember, I was talking about what can occur when a dissolution or a liquidation of a corporation so far as preferred stock is concerned.

Remember, I was talking to you about Columbus in setting out to discover America, and I said Queen Isabella would have made an investment, and King Ferdinand under my hypothetical would have loaned the money. Historically, of course, I was not every accurate, and perhaps I should in the light of what we know about the risks attendant to Columbus\rquote  voyage point out that if the risks of the return of King Ferdinand\rquote s, what I call a loan\u8211\'3fif the risk was so great that there was no other place to look for the return of that loan except to the success of the voyage itself, that no matter what label Columbus and King Ferdinand put on it it would have been an investment in equity. It would have been strictly on the risk of the venture and therefore it would have been equity, and everybody would have known that it was an equity.

Now, of course, I could change the facts around and violate history a little bit more by saying that the venture was pretty surely to be a successful one and besides that Columbus had money in the bank, at home or something else, but it is true, and this is a point that if the risk is very great, highly great, as perhaps it actually was so far as Columbus was concerned, that the money placed with him, no matter what he and anybody else would have called it, would have been an investment in equity.

It was also testimony, as I recall it from Mr. Whiteley, that as he evaluated the ratio it was 16 to 1 and therefore in his evaluation would have been a more risky investment than had the ratio been 10 to 1, as I indicated to you. All right.
