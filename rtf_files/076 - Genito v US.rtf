Plaintiffs, James J. Genito and Josephine Genito, his wife, instituted suit against the United States to recover income tax deficiencies assessed against them for the years 1967 through 1970, deficiencies totaling $19,838.83. They also seek recovery of penalties totaling $991.94. The deficiencies arose by reason of the Government\rquote s contention that certain corporate advances to James Genito were dividends rather than loans as claimed by the taxpayers. Jurisdiction is asserted under

As to the facts, in 1945 Genito and his father formed the business which has for many years been known as Grant Tool & Manufacturing Company, Inc., which I will refer to as Grant. It was incorporated in 1946.

For many years Genito has in effect been the sole owner and manager of Grant, although his wife and secretary own some shares. Grant is literally a \u8220\'3fMom and Pop\u8221\'3f tool and die machinery company. It has conducted its business in a converted garage. Genito and his wife moved into four rooms above the first floor of the garage shortly after they were married in 1947. A son and daughter were born to them while they lived in the apartment.

Genito put all his time, energies and resources into Grant. For many years he drew a salary of approximately a hundred dollars a week and until 1967 made loans to Grant when the company was in need of funds. These loans were set up on the books of the company as loans, although no notes or security were given, and no interest was paid.

When these contracts were received, Government inspectors moved into the Grant facilities to monitor the work and to insure adequate security. They were disturbed by the Genito living arrangement which involved the parents and their nine-year-old daughter and three-year-old son traversing the work area and offices to get to and from their living quarters. Further, the operations required more office space and secure storage space.

 At that time Grant had borrowed heavily, and Genito and his wife had co-signed or otherwise guaranteed the debt instruments. Genito had no other assets except his interest in Grant. This fact, together with the existence of his contingent liability on the corporate debt, made it impossible for him to borrow from a bank or other credit institution to finance the purchase or construction of a home into which he could move his family.

These sums represented advances which Genito had made to the corporation.

The amounts of such loans shown at the end of the fiscal years in 1968, 1969, 1970 and 1971 were respectively $18,130, $17,776, $51,218.65 and $53,748.28.

 would consider lending Genito these sums on the terms and conditions applicable to the advances which Genito received. Genito received funds on these terms and conditions only because he was in absolute control of Grant and could dictate its policy. For the most part, the various criteria effectively employed by courts to decide if advances are a loan or a dividend confirm this conclusion, that these advances were not loans \u8211\'3f that there was no real intent to repay these sums, namely, these factors being, first, absence of a future payment date; second, absence of any written evidence of indebtedness; third, Genito\rquote s control of the corporation; fourth, the absence of any security; fifth, the absence of an effort on the part of the corporation to collect; sixth, the important family and personal ends which were served by the advances; seventh, the absence of any corporate dividends over the years, even though the corporation had substantial retained earnings; eighth, the absence of any interest payments or requirements; and, ninth, repayment of loans after receipt of the deficiency letter.

 In addition, there are other indicia in the record which support the conclusion that at the time the advances were made, Genito did not view them as carrying with them a firm obligation to repay the corporation. On deposition, Genito stated he was trying to get back from his company the money he had put into it. He asserted he had worked for the money, he had earned it. It was his salary.
