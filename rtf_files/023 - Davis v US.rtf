James Davis, Sr., father of James, Jr., died on June 19, 1952. His last will and testament was admitted to probate July 15, 1952, by the Probate Court of Sedgwick County, Kansas. On that date the taxpayer was appointed executor, duly qualified as such, and has since continued to act as such executor. James, Jr. is also sole beneficiary under the will and testament of the decedent and will be the sole distributee of the estate of the decedent when the final distribution of the assets of such estate is made.

On December 26, 1952, James, Jr., acting as executor, filed a petition in the Probate Court seeking instructions and advice concerning the sale of the estate\rquote s shares in such working interests. In the petition he alleged, inter alia, that in the opinion of independent engineers and accounts the reasonable value of the estate\rquote s undivided interests was $530,923.82; that the further development of such leases was a hazardous undertaking in which the estate should not be engaged; and that as executor he had received from James, Jr., individually, an offer to purchase the estate\rquote s shares in the working interests in such leases for $175,000 in cash, with a reserved interest to the estate of 75 per cent of the oil, gas and casinghead gas first discovered, produced, saved and sold until the value of such reserved 75 per cent, computed at the current market price, should equal $375,000.

The Probate Court found, in a nonadversary proceeding, but on the basis of evidence introduced at the hearing on the petition, that the offer set forth in the petition was fair and reasonable and was for the full value of the estate\rquote s interest in such leases; that the sale would be for the best interests of the estate; that it would be advantageous to the estate to be relieved from the hazardous undertaking of operating and developing such leases; and that it was necessary, because of the heavy Federal estate tax and state inheritance tax burden, to conserve the cash in such estate. It ordered approval of the sale upon the terms and conditions set forth in the petition and the consummation thereof by a proposed assignment, copy of which was attached to the petition, and ordered the execution and delivery of such assignment upon the payment to the executor of $175,000 in cash by James, Jr., individually.

In the assignment the estate expressly reserved 75 per cent of the oil, gas and casinghead gas discovered, produced, saved and sold from its interests in the oil and gas leases, until the value of such products should equal $375,000 and provided for a release of the reserved interests when the estate had received such products of the value of $375,000. The amount of $375,000 was to be received by the estate only in oil, gas and casinghead gas produced, saved and sold from the reserved interests. There was no personal obligation on James, Jr. to pay such amount and no security by way of lien or otherwise was given to the estate to secure the payment thereof. It is clear, therefore, that on the face of the transaction the estate reserved an economic interest in the oil and gas in place; that the payments received from the sale of oil and gas produced from such reserved interests were taxable to it and not James, Jr. and that it was entitled to a depletion allowance in respect thereof.

 But if we assume that the order of the Probate Court was tantamount to an order for partial distribution, it did not distribute the interest reserved to the estate under the assignment, namely, 75 per cent of the oil and gas produced and sold from the leases until the value thereof equalled $375,000, which event did not occur until 1954. Unless and until production from 75 per cent of the estate\rquote s reserved interests in the leases equalled in value $375,000, the reserved interests in the leases were to remain in the estate and were not to pass to James, Jr.
