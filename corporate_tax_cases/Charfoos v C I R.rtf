The issues for decision are: (1) Whether operating losses generated by petitioner\rquote s yacht-chartering activity are attributable to petitioner as an individual or to a separately taxable corporation that petitioner organized; (2) if the losses are attributable to petitioner as an individual, whether he is entitled to deduct them from his gross income because he engaged in the chartering activity with an actual and honest profit objective as required by section 183; (3) assuming the losses are attributable to petitioner and petitioner engaged in the yacht-chartering activity with the requisite profit objective, whether respondent nonetheless properly disallowed certain Schedule C deductions because petitioner failed to properly establish his entitlement to them; (4) whether petitioner accurately reported income and a depletion expense from a drilling partnership on his 1981 tax return; (5) whether petitioner was entitled to an $8,562 casualty loss deduction on his 1981 tax return; and (6) whether petitioner is liable for the additions to tax determined by respondent for negligence and for the substantial understatement of income tax.

Petitioner first became interested in the yacht-chartering business in June 1979 when he and three friends chartered a 79-foot motor yacht, named Colinga, for a 2-week vacation cruise on the French Riviera. The Colinga was built in England in 1969 and, at the time of petitioner\rquote s cruise, had two double cabins, two single cabins, adjoining bathrooms, separate crew quarters, spacious living room, dining room, modern galley, air conditioning, after deck, flying bridge, sunbathing area, and many modern conveniences. In 1979, the Colinga had been used as a charter yacht only occasionally by her owners. The Colinga\rquote s first owner, an elderly Englishman named Evelyn Jones, used the yacht with his family for recreational purposes until 1975, when he decided to renovate her for possible use as a charter yacht in the Mediterranean yacht charter market. He hired Barry Piggin, an experienced English seaman and personal friend, to be the Colinga\rquote s skipper and to begin the repairs and renovations. In 1976, Mr. Jones chartered the Colinga to several parties for overnight trips, even though the planned repairs had not yet been completed.

In 1977, before the Colinga\rquote s renovations were completed, Mr. Jones sold her to Hroar Hansen, a Norwegian citizen. Although Mr. Hansen chartered the Colinga to paying guests a few times in 1977 and 1978, he and his family used the yacht primarily for their own recreation. Mr. Hansen retained Captain Piggin as the Colinga\rquote s skipper, and Heather Piggin as the yacht\rquote s cook and bookkeeper. Captain and Heather Piggin thought that the interior of the yacht was becoming shabby and that a lot of money needed to be spent in order to properly maintain the Colinga\rquote s hull, engine, and mechanical parts. The Piggins tried to convince Mr. Hansen to complete the renovations that the first owner had begun. However, in the fall of 1978, Mr. Hansen suffered some large, unrelated business losses, and became financially unable to pay the Piggins\rquote  salaries or any of the bills that the boat incurred, or to complete the repairs that Captain Piggin felt were necessary to make the Colinga competitive in the Mediterranean charter market. Captain and Heather Piggin began to pay the Colinga\rquote s operating expenses and invested their own money to complete the mechanical repairs Captain Piggin felt were essential. The Piggins believed they could recoup their investment in the approaching Mediterranean charter season which runs from May through October. The Piggins also began to keep an eye out for a prospective buyer with enough money and the desire to complete other mechanical repairs, as well as renovations to the Colinga\rquote s interior that the Piggins felt were much needed.

Petitioner and his three friends were one of the first groups to charter the Colinga in 1979. During their cruise, petitioner began talking with Captain and Heather Piggin about the business of yacht chartering in general. Captain Piggin told petitioner that the Colinga could probably be purchased at a very low price due to the financial position of Mr. Hansen. In the 1960\rquote s petitioner and a friend had co-owned a 35-foot cabin cruiser which they used for recreational purposes in Detroit. Petitioner has also previously owned several small speed boats and chartered a yacht for a Caribbean vacation. However, before 1979, petitioner had never owned a large yacht nor operated any form of yacht-chartering business. The opportunity to buy the Colinga at a low price and obtain what petitioner believed to be an ongoing charter business, piqued his interest. Petitioner was also very impressed by the Piggins\rquote  yachting experience, as well as their reputation and demeanor as professional crew members.

During the cruise, petitioner\rquote s discussions with the Piggins became focused on the Colinga\rquote s average operating expenses and charter revenues, marketing ideas, and the specific repairs and renovations that the Piggins felt were necessary. During one of these discussions, petitioner jotted down four pages of notes summarizing the Piggins\rquote  estimates of the Colinga\rquote s yearly operating expenses. The Piggins based their estimates of expenses on their general familiarity with the operation of the Colinga; the yacht\rquote s operating expenses and repairs which they had paid out of their own pockets when Mr. Hansen began having financial difficulties in the fall of 1978; and on the yacht\rquote s bank statements, bank journal, and petty cash book, all of which were kept on board by Heather Piggin. Petitioner was allowed to view these records during their discussions.

{\b0 \cf19 \f2 \ul0 \strike0 \i0 \fs20 \sa0 \sb0 
Petitioner\rquote s informal, four-page estimate included some of the larger fixed costs associated with operating a charter business such as water, electricity, moorage, chandlery, daily maintenance, and the crew\rquote s salaries, uniforms, and food. Petitioner determined that he could offset these expenses if he had at least 8 weeks of yacht rentals each charter season.

Petitioner was aware that in order to adapt the Colinga for continuous charter service, a number of expensive improvements would be required, including the overhaul of the engines and the replacement of the anchor, air conditioning system, and speed boat. However, petitioner did not take the cost of these needed improvements into account when initially estimating his expenses. Nor did he consider the full cost of maintenance, insurance, interest on a mortgage loan, his air travel, and the potential of fluctuations in the foreign currency exchange rates. By the end of his 2-week vacation cruise, petitioner decided that, if he could negotiate a low price, he would like to purchase the Colinga and utilize her as a Mediterranean charter yacht. He also told the Piggins that he wanted to hire them as the Colinga\rquote s crew, pursuant to a 5-year employment contract.

In July 1979, after petitioner had returned to the United States, but prior to his purchase of the Colinga, Captain Piggin sent him a detailed, typewritten estimate of the all expenditures needed to upgrade and restore the yacht. The estimate was broken down in terms of \u8220\'3fwinter\u8221\'3f and \u8220\'3fsummer\u8221\'3f running expenses and \u8220\'3fnecessary\u8221\'3f and \u8220\'3fsuggested\u8221\'3f improvements. The estimates were in French currency and were not converted to dollar figures. Petitioner did not verify or investigate the estimates made by Captain Piggin and Heather. However, petitioner felt that he could rely on the accuracy of the Piggins\rquote  estimates for expenses and improvements because of their expertise with yachts, the fact that they shopped for many of the spare parts and refurbishings themselves, and because Captain Piggin performed many of the Colinga\rquote s repairs.

According to the letter, the original purchase survey, slipping, and work expenses were not included in the 1978-79 records. Furthermore, all other expenses, such as the replacement of the radar, winter slipping, and various repairs, were carried forward to the following season. Thus, the 1978-79 records only showed income and a few of the day-to-day expenses.

He also hired Captain Piggin\rquote s wife, Heather, to be the Colinga\rquote s cook, bookkeeper, and interior designer. The Piggins only wanted to be associated with a yacht that was used solely for charters during the charter season because they required a 5-percent commission on \u8220\'3fnet charter income.\u8221\'3f Net charter income is the gross charter income less a 15-percent commission for the agent who found the charterer.

In order to protect a vessel from possible terrorism and to comply with various international laws, it is customary for the owner of an ocean-going vessels to officially enroll the vessel on the ship register of a home country. When petitioner purchased the Colinga, it was registered under the Norwegian flag, but due to the change in the Colinga\rquote s ownership, the yacht had to be re-registered. The Colinga could have been registered in the United States, France, Great Britain, Liberia, Malta, or Panama. Captain Piggin wanted the Colinga to fly the flag of Great Britain, since he and his wife were English. He also thought the British flag would be helpful in marketing the yacht to charterers. Initially, petitioner wanted to register the Colinga in the United States but discovered that, in order to do so, a vessel\rquote s owner must transport the vessel to the United States for inspection by the Coast Guard. Because of the expense and impracticality of transporting the Colinga to the United States, and the fact that Captain Piggin wanted to fly the British flag at the yacht\rquote s stern, petitioner decided to try to qualify the yacht to be registered in Great Britain. A vessel may only be listed on the British Ship Registry by its owner, who must be either a resident person in the United Kingdom or a corporation organized under the laws of the United Kingdom. Since petitioner was an individual residing in Detroit, Michigan, he could not legally register the Colinga on the British Ship Registry in his own capacity. Petitioner, therefore, at the suggestion of Yachting Partners, contacted Bachmann & Co. Ltd. (hereinafter Bachmann & Co.), an international marine management consulting firm that specializes in qualifying vessels to be listed on ship registers of various countries, including Great Britain.

The day-to-day chartering operations of the Colinga and the Sea Crest were carried on by their respective captains and crew who communicated regularly over the telephone with petitioner. Most of the Colinga\rquote s records and invoices kept by the Piggins were furnished to petitioner\rquote s law office in Detroit, Michigan, where his bookkeeper, Winifred Kissick, summarized them at the end of the year for petitioner\rquote s accountants. Petitioner did not submit any receipts or records of expenses generated by the Sea Crest in 1981 and 1982.

During the years in issue, petitioner personally used the yacht Colinga three times. He took 1-week cruises on the yacht in September 1980, May 1981, and September 1981. After the cruises, petitioner usually stayed for several days in France, where he had an apartment.

On his 1980, 1981, and 1982 tax returns, petitioner claimed certain deductions for expenses related to his yacht-chartering activity, including depreciation of the yachts, business travel expenses, legal and professional fees, and \u8220\'3ffitting out\u8221\'3f expenses for renovation of the yacht Colinga. In the deficiency notice, respondent disallowed the deductions claiming that the expenses were attributable to the corporation, Colinga Ltd., in 1980, 1981, and 1982, and thus were not ordinary and necessary expenses attributable to a trade or business of petitioner. Alternatively, if the yacht- chartering losses are petitioner\rquote s losses, respondent disallowed the following deductions claimed by petitioner, resulting in increases to his taxable income.

In the notice of deficiency, respondent increased petitioner\rquote s share of income from the partnership by $9,923 and reduced his depletion expense in the amount of $2,173.

Respondent asserts that petitioner was not entitled to deduct the net operating losses from the yacht-chartering activity on his 1980, 1981, and 1982 tax returns because in those years the losses are attributable to Colinga Ltd., a separate taxable corporation that petitioner organized, and not to petitioner as an individual. If we determine that the yacht-chartering losses are attributable to petitioner individually, respondent asserts that petitioner is nonetheless not entitled to deduct the losses because he did not engage in the yacht-chartering activity with an objective to make a profit as required by section 183. In the event we determine that the losses are attributable to petitioner and that his yacht-chartering activity was carried on for profit, respondent argues that certain adjustments must be made to the Schedule C deductions petitioner claimed for the yachts\rquote  depreciation, the \u8220\'3ffitting out\u8221\'3f or yacht renovation expenses, and the travel, legal, and professional fee expenses incurred in connection with the yacht-chartering operation. Finally, respondent asserts that petitioner is liable for additions to tax for negligence and for substantially understating his income tax.

. Petitioner contends, however, that the operating losses sustained in the yacht-chartering activity are attributable to himself because the corporation was merely functioning as petitioner\rquote s agent and never held any beneficial interest in the yachts Colinga and Sea Crest. Petitioner further argues that there is plenty of evidence in the record to show he engaged in the yacht-chartering activity to make a profit and that he, therefore, is entitled to deduct the operating losses on his individual tax returns. Finally, petitioner asserts that respondent\rquote s determination of additions to tax is improper because he was not negligent and did not substantially understate his income tax for any of the years in issue.

In general, the statutory notice of tax deficiency is presumed to be correct and petitioner bears the burden of proving respondent\rquote s determinations are in error. Rule 142(a). In particular, deductions are a matter of legislative grace and entitlement thereto must be shown by petitioner.

We find it significant that petitioner took deliberate steps to incorporate his yacht-chartering operation. He hired Bachmann & Co., an international marine management consulting firm, to help him organize Charter Company Limited, which in December 1979 was registered as a corporation in Guernsey, Channel Islands, United Kingdom. The formalities of incorporation were followed: articles of incorporation were filed and directors and shareholders were named in the incorporation documents. Petitioner admits that in March 1980 he conveyed the Colinga\rquote s record title to the newly formed corporation and that in October 1981 the corporation purchased a second yacht, Sea Crest, in its own name. The corporation had a bona fide business purpose. By petitioner\rquote s own admission, its \u8220\'3fsole purpose\u8221\'3f was to qualify the yachts to be listed on the British Ship Registry, which could be accomplished only by an individual owner residing in the United Kingdom or a corporation organized under the laws of the United Kingdom. Petitioner argues however, that given the corporation\rquote s limited purpose, to treat it as the owner of the yachts for tax purposes would be to exalt the corporate form over its substance. Petitioner\rquote s argument is not without some appeal, but we conclude it should not be accepted.

. However, in this situation we find petitioner\rquote s claims to be inconsistent with his admission that Colinga Ltd. was a valid corporation in conformity with Moline Properties. Inc. v. Commissioner, supra. Petitioner states that the corporation\rquote s business purpose was to qualify the yachts to be registered on the British Ship Registry, which by law could only be accomplished by the yachts\rquote  owner who had to be either an individual residing in Great Britain or a corporation organized under the laws of Great Britain. Furthermore, the Colinga and the Sea Crest were the only assets that were placed in the corpus of the corporation when it was registered. To now treat petitioner as the owner of the yachts for tax purposes appears to contravene Colinga Ltd.\rquote s corporate existence.

Moreover, Colinga Ltd. did not have a corporate existence when the management agreement was executed and signed. Since the corporation was not registered until December 1979, 1 month after the management agreement was executed, the management agreement could not effectively bind the corporation to an agency relationship with petitioner, regardless of its terms. The evidence submitted by petitioner to support his claim that Colinga Ltd. functioned as his agent with respect to the yacht-chartering activity is unpersuasive and would require us to speculate as to actual events. Because such evidence of an agency relationship is not only conjectural, but falls far short of being unequivocal, as required by the Supreme Court, we reject this claim.

If petitioner, an experienced and seasoned products liability attorney, had meant to retain beneficial ownership of the Colinga, certainly one of these sales documents would refer to that fact.

We are not persuaded by petitioner\rquote s argument that the document which he executed purporting to be a settlement of trust, requires us to find that he held a beneficial interest in the yachts. The alleged trust is undated and appears to have only $100 in its corpus. Petitioner is not named as a beneficiary of the trust. Accordingly, we shall disregard it.

We have found that petitioner organized the corporation, Colinga Ltd., for the business purpose of registering the yachts in Great Britain, that the corporation was the legal and beneficial owner of the yachts Colinga and Sea Crest, and that the corporation conducted the yacht-chartering business in its own name. Having set up a separate entity through which to conduct his affairs, petitioner must live with the tax consequences of that choice. Indeed, the very exigency which led to his use of the corporation serves to emphasize the entity\rquote s separate existence. The tide of judicial history is too strong to enable petitioner to prevail on this issue, albeit that the purpose of the corporation was limited in scope. Therefore, we hold that the corporation, Colinga Ltd., was the owner of the yachts and the yacht-chartering operation for tax purposes and that the yacht- chartering losses are attributable to it, rather than petitioner in his individual capacity. Accordingly, we sustain respondent\rquote s disallowance of petitioner\rquote s claimed deductions of the chartering losses.

Because we have determined that petitioner was not entitled to claim deductions for the yacht-chartering losses on his 1980, 1981, and 1982 individual tax returns, there is no need for us to address the second issue of whether petitioner had the objective to make a profit in the yacht-chartering activity as required by section 183.

In the deficiency notice, respondent first asserts that the deductions are not allowable because the expenses are attributable to the corporation, Colinga Ltd., and not to a trade or business owned by petitioner. In the alternative, respondent asserts that the deductions are not allowable because the yachting operation was not carried on by him for profit. If it is determined that petitioner owned the yacht-chartering operation and that the activity was carried on by him for profit, respondent asserts that: (1) The fitting-out expense deduction is nonetheless not allowable because it is a capital expenditure within the meaning of section 263; (2) the depreciation deduction is not allowable because the Colinga has a salvage value equal to or greater than the cost and improvements to the yacht, or it has a useful life of 20 years instead of 10 years as reported on petitioner\rquote s returns; and (3) the travel, legal, and professional expense deductions are not allowable because petitioner failed to establish that they were ordinary and necessary expenses or expended for the purpose designated.

The sixth issue for our decision is whether petitioner is liable for additions to tax under section 6653(a) in 1980 and section 6653(a)(1) and (2) in 1981 and 1982. Section 6653(a) and 6653(a)(1) provide that where any part of the underpayment of income tax is due to negligence or intentional disregard of the rules and regulations, an additional amount equal to 5 percent of the underpayment may be added to the tax. Section 6653(a)(2) imposes an addition to tax equal to 50 percent of the interest computed on the portion of the underpayment that is attributable to negligence or the intentional disregard of the rules and regulations. Negligence under these sections is defined as the lack of due care or the failure to do what a reasonable and ordinarily prudent person would do under the circumstances.

After considering the particular circumstances of this case, we find that petitioner\rquote s underpayment of tax was not the result of a totally honest mistake; rather, it was caused by his negligence. Petitioner deliberately organized the corporation out of a business necessity. He signed numerous documents listing Charter Company, Limited, later renamed Colinga Ltd., as the owner of the yachts. He represented to the British Government that the corporation owned the yachts. It was not reasonable or prudent for him to then claim himself to be the owner of the yachts on his tax returns.

We find it especially significant that petitioner is a seasoned attorney who specializes in personal injury and products liability law. His reputation as an attorney has allowed him to publish at least two law textbooks. He also retained several experienced business advisers. Petitioner\rquote s expertise persuades us that he must have known that a corporation, if properly formed, takes on its own life as a separate entity for liability and taxation purposes. In short, petitioner must have been aware of the risk he was taking when he deducted the large yacht- chartering losses on his personal tax returns.

Petitioner argues that he was not negligent in claiming the yacht-chartering deductions on his individual returns since he relied upon the advice of several attorneys and a certified public accountant in doing so. We have recognized that additions to tax for negligence are inappropriate where a taxpayer, in good faith, reasonably relies on his tax advisers.

 The record, however, fails to establish that petitioner reasonably relied on a professional\rquote s advice after full disclosure. Petitioner testified that he consulted with his attorney, Eugene Gargaro, Jr., in claiming the chartering loss deductions. However, despite Mr. Gargaro\rquote s availability in Court, petitioner chose not to call him to the witness stand. The only reasonable inference from petitioner\rquote s failure to do so is that Mr. Gargaro\rquote s testimony would have been unfavorable to petitioner. Wichita Terminal Elevator Co. v.

Donovan Miller, the certified public accountant who prepared petitioner\rquote s 1980, 1981, and 1982 tax returns, did testify. However, Mr. Miller did not state that he independently made any determinations upon which petitioner could have relied. Rather, he testified that petitioner and his bookkeeper, Winifred Kissick, provided him with lists of items which he simply transferred to the returns. Petitioner has failed to carry his burden of proving that he was not negligent in claiming the deductions related to the yacht- chartering operation. Accordingly, we sustain the additions to tax as determined by respondent under section 6653(a) for 1980 and paragraphs (1) and (2) for 1981 and 1982.

Finally, we must decide whether petitioner is liable for an addition to tax of $13,211.11 under section 6661 for substantially understating his income tax on his 1982 return. Section 6661, as originally enacted in 1982, set the amount of the addition at 10 percent of the amount of any underpayment attributable to the substantial understatement.

Respondent asserts that he correctly determined the addition to tax under section 6661 because substantial authority did not exist for petitioner\rquote s claim to the deduction of the yacht-chartering losses on his individual tax return. We have held that the yacht- chartering losses are attributable to the separately taxable corporation that petitioner created and not to petitioner in his individual capacity. The case law in existence in 1982 does not constitute substantial authority for petitioner\rquote s treatment of the yacht-chartering losses as his own. To the contrary, the Supreme Court in
