 P commenced a cash tender offer for a large part of the publicly traded stock of Conoco. Conoco thereafter entered into an agreement with DuPont Holdings, Inc. (DT), a subsidiary of DuPont, pursuant to which DT commenced a competing tender offer for all of the stock of Conoco. DT offered cash and publicly-traded DuPont stock for Conoco stock. The agreement between Conoco and DT called for Conoco to be merged into DT if DT acquired more than 50 percent of Conoco\rquote s stock. As of the expiration of withdrawal rights under its tender offer, DT had been tendered in excess of 50 percent of Conoco\rquote s stock while P under its tender offer had acquired approximately 32 percent of Conoco\rquote s stock. Because DT had successfully acquired control of Conoco, P tendered its Conoco stock in exchange for DuPont stock. Thereafter, Conoco merged into DT. P claims a loss on the exchange.

On May 6, 1981, Dome Petroleum Ltd. (Dome) commenced a tender offer for approximately 20 percent of the common stock of Conoco, Inc. (Conoco), a Delaware corporation engaged in the oil and gas industry as an \u8220\'3fintegrated oil company.\u8221\'3f At all relevant times, Conoco\rquote s stock was traded on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). On May 27, 1981, Dome announced that approximately 50 percent of the common stock of Conoco had been tendered pursuant to its offer. On June 1, 1981, Conoco and Dome agreed that Conoco would trade the stock of one of its subsidiaries, Hudson\rquote s Bay Oil & Gas Company Ltd., for Dome\rquote s Conoco stock plus $245 million. This trade was effected on June 10, 1981.

SCL, which is unrelated to Dome, had no prior knowledge of the Dome tender offer and played no role in the June, 1981 Dome/Conoco transaction. Because of the response of Conoco\rquote s shareholders to the Dome tender offer, however, SCL believed that it might be able to negotiate to obtain a significant investment in Conoco.

Between May 29 and June 17, 1981, SCL conducted extensive negotiations with Conoco concerning proposals for it to acquire directly from Conoco, and/or through open-market purchases, between 18 percent and 35 percent of the common stock of Conoco. On May 29, 1981, Edgar M. Bronfman, chairman and chief executive officer of SCL, arranged a meeting with Conoco officials. On May 30, 1981, Bronfman proposed that SCL acquire 35 percent of the stock of Conoco and enter into a \u8220\'3fstandstill\u8221\'3f agreement with respect to this investment. On May 31, 1981, Ralph E. Bailey, chairman and chief executive officer of Conoco, stated that he preferred a 25 percent SCL investment in Conoco. Bronfman thereafter made a presentation to the Conoco board of directors.

From June 1 to June 15, 1981, representatives of SCL and Conoco, and their respective advisers, met and negotiated concerning an agreement. On June 14, 1981, SCL delivered a draft agreement whereby it or a subsidiary would acquire at least 18 percent of the Conoco shares and would agree not to acquire more than a total of 25 percent of such shares for a 15\u8211\'3fyear period, subject to certain conditions. On June 15, 1981, Bronfman offered to acquire 25 percent of Conoco\rquote s shares in direct purchases from Conoco for $70 per share. Alternatively, Bronfman proposed that SCL purchase a portion of its investment in Conoco through open-market purchases. On June 17, 1981, Bailey informed Bronfman that the Conoco board of directors had rejected the proposal for a significant investment in Conoco by SCL or its subsidiaries, claiming that it would not be in the long-term interests of Conoco.

On June 24, 1981, Edward G. Jefferson, chairman and chief executive officer of E.I. DuPont de Nemours and Co. (DuPont), called Bailey to determine whether there was any constructive role DuPont might play in light of public reports. DuPont is principally engaged in manufacturing and selling diversified lines of chemicals, plastics, specialty products, and fibers. DuPont\rquote s stock is traded on the NYSE. On June 25, 1981, Bailey contacted Jefferson to determine if DuPont would be interested in the possibility of a merger with Conoco. Beginning on June 28, 1981, Conoco and DuPont representatives discussed a possible merger.

The last date for the withdrawal of tendered shares was August 6, 1981, and the offer was set to expire on August 13, 1981. Mobil\rquote s obligation to purchase was conditioned on its receiving tenders for a minimum of 43,500,000 common shares of Conoco.

Because of this oversubscription, shareholders who have not yet tendered their shares will receive only DuPont stock if they tender to DuPont, while shareholders who have already tendered may receive DuPont stock even though they elected to receive cash.

Any tenders previously made to DuPont or Mobil are not irrevocable and may still be withdrawn.

Dupont treated the tender offer and merger as a tax-free reorganization for Federal income tax purposes and filed its tax return for its 1981 taxable year accordingly. Dupont and Conoco advised former Conoco shareholders who had exchanged their stock for DuPont stock in either the exchange portion of the tender offer or the merger that they had no taxable gain or loss.

The Commissioner, seeking to apply the step transaction doctrine, sought to recharacterize the tender offer/redemption as a sale of assets followed by a self-tender. While it is true that we held that each of the preliminary steps leading to the tender offer/redemption had an independent function, we also held that the form of the overall transaction coincided with its substance, and was to be respected. In the case before us, petitioner would have us respect the independent significance of DuPont\rquote s tender offer, but disregard the overall transaction, which included the Merger.

1. After DuPont waived its precondition that it receive tenders of at least 51 percent of the Conoco shares, DuPont opened up the possibility, if its option to acquire 15,900,000 shares from Conoco were declared invalid, that it would not acquire enough Conoco stock to be able to effectuate the Merger.

The DuPont/Conoco Agreement was the definitive vehicle spelling out the interrelated steps by which DuPont would acquire 100 percent of Conoco\rquote s stock. To explain the mechanics of the type of procedure utilized by DuPont and Conoco, respondent submitted an \u8220\'3fExpert Affidavit\u8221\'3f of Bernard S. Black. Black is a Professor of Law at the Columbia University School of Law, where he teaches courses in Corporate Finance, Securities and Capital Markets Regulations, and Corporate Acquisitions. He is co-author of, among other treatises, The Law and Finance of Corporate Acquisitions. We found his affidavit, although on occasion somewhat argumentative, to be cogent, apparently well informed, and generally convincing.

 In substance, DuPont\rquote s bid for Conoco was a minor variant on a standard two-step acquisition, in which the parties sign a merger agreement that contemplates a first-step cash tender offer, to be followed by a second-step merger. The parties to an acquisition often use this transaction form, rather than a single-step merger (without a tender offer), because a tender offer can close faster than a merger, which increases the likelihood that the acquisition will be completed.

 We do not view DuPont\rquote s increase in the price it was willing to pay for the Conoco shares, or the reduction in the percentage of Conoco shares acceptable under the DuPont tender offer, to be vitiating steps, since both steps benefited the Conoco shareholders and were steps taken to assure the success of the plan of reorganization, not to enlarge it outside its initial confines.

The parties stipulated that petitioner and DuPont, through their wholly owned subsidiaries, were acting independently of one another and pursuant to competing tender offers. Furthermore, there is of course nothing in the record to suggest any prearranged understanding between petitioner and DuPont that petitioner would tender the Conoco stock purchased for cash if petitioner by means of its own tender offer failed to achieve control of Conoco. Consequently, it cannot be argued that petitioner, although not a party to the reorganization, was somehow acting in concert with DuPont, which

The Commissioner clearly would agree that there would be insufficient continuity if the public shareholders who exchanged Conoco shares for DuPont shares sold their shares of DuPont to Seagram the day after the merger.

We do not believe petitioner\rquote s analogy is appropriate, because in a case such as the one before us we must look not to the identity of the target\rquote s shareholders, but rather to what the shares represented when the reorganization was completed.

 In this case, a majority of the old shares of Conoco were converted to shares of DuPont in the reorganization, so that in the sense, at least, that a majority of the consideration was the acquiring corporation\rquote s stock, the test of continuity was met. In this aspect of the case step transaction and continuity questions would have arisen only had there been some preexisting intention or arrangement for the disposal of the newly acquired DuPont shares, but there were none.

Respondent points out, correctly we believe, that the concept of continuity of interest advocated by petitioner would go far toward eliminating the possibility of a tax-free reorganization of any corporation whose stock is actively traded. Because it would be impossible to track the large volume of third party transactions in the target\rquote s stock, all completed transactions would be suspect. Sales of target stock for cash after the date of the announcement of an acquisition can neither be predicted nor controlled by publicly held parties to a reorganization. A requirement that the identity of the acquired corporation\rquote s shareholders be tracked to assume a sufficient number of \u8220\'3fhistoric\u8221\'3f shareholders to satisfy some arbitrary minimal percentage receiving the acquiring corporation\rquote s stock would be completely unrealistic.
