During the year ended December 31, 1973, the county treasurer of Montgomery County, Ill., issued checks to 132 individual shareholders of the petitioner in amounts corresponding to the personal property tax deposited on their behalf by the petitioner. The amounts so paid to said individual shareholders were not transferred or repaid to petitioner. No payment was made by the county treasurer directly to petitioner. No tax refunds were made by the county treasurer to 17 other shareholders in petitioner, who were neither natural persons nor two or more natural persons owning shares as joint tenants or tenants in common.

At that time, its assets first exceeded $25 million and petitioner was required, under regulations promulgated by the Comptroller of Currency, to carry certain items on the accrual method of accounting on its financial books and records.

Petitioner never sought respondent\rquote s permission to change its accounting method.

 Petitioner paid these taxes on behalf of both its individual shareholders and \u8220\'3fnonindividual\u8221\'3f shareholders (e.g., corporations). The ad valorem tax on the shares of stock held by individual shareholders was subsequently determined to be invalid and the amounts petitioner had paid with respect to these shares were refunded, along with accrued interest, during petitioner\rquote s taxable year ended December 31, 1973. The refunds were made not to the bank, however, but to the individual shareholders on whose behalf petitioner had paid the tax. The question for our decision herein is whether or not the refunds of amounts to petitioner\rquote s shareholders, which were originally paid and deducted by petitioner to its tax benefit, constitute a sufficient \u8220\'3frecovery\u8221\'3f so as to trigger income to petitioner under the tax benefit rule and section 111.

 Petitioner\rquote s argument is simple. It argues that, as it was at all times relevant hereto on a cash basis of accounting for tax purposes and as it never actually received any amount of the refunded taxes, it cannot be held to have had a \u8220\'3frecovery\u8221\'3f for purposes of the tax benefit rule. Respondent\rquote s argument is more complex. He argues, firstly, that petitioner has had a \u8220\'3frecovery\u8221\'3f because it not only deducted the taxes when paid, but also received a second benefit from payment of the taxes by way of \u8220\'3fthe discharge (in 1973) of petitioner\rquote s liability to its individual shareholders * * * to treat shareholders of the same class equally in the declaration and payment of dividends.\u8221\'3f Alternatively, respondent argues that \u8220\'3funder Illinois law, the County Collector, having received funds in respect of a liability which was later held unconstitutional, held those funds upon a constructive trust for the rightful owner of the property, namely, the transferor, the petitioner.\u8221\'3f
}
{\b0 \cf19 \f2 \ul0 \strike0 \i0 \fs20 \sa0 \sb0 
 Under this line of argument, respondent would have us find that petitioner had constructively received the refunded amounts and then paid these amounts out in discharge of its obligation to treat all shareholders of the same class equally with respect to the payment of dividends.

The tax benefit rule is a judicially created doctrine embodying both transactional tax accounting and equitable aspects.

We held, in effect, that the recovery of this benefit by the subsidiary\rquote s shareholders was a sufficient recovery to tax their corporation.

 associations to obtain refunds of 1971 personal property taxes paid by them on their capital stock owned by individuals. The decision is one affecting substantial rights and was decided after an adversary hearing. In that case, the Illinois Court of Appeals (1) impliedly found that the banks had an interest in the refunds, and (2) ordered refunds to be made directly to the individual shareholders for whom the funds had been originally paid out. Apparently, this mode of repayment was seized upon so as to avoid the need of channeling the money through the banks to the shareholders:

a refund to the banks would be grossly inequitable. This would enable the banks to hold these refunds as part of their general assets which in turn would redound to the proportionate benefit of all shareholders, including those legal persons not individuals to whom the legislature never intended to make refunds. To sustain plaintiffs\rquote  contention but also to channel the refunds to the natural owners exclusively in accordance with the clear mandate of the constitutional referendum, as construed by the courts, the refunds would necessarily be made to the banks for the use and benefit of only the natural persons owning stock. This would present administrative and other problems which would best be solved by remitting the refunds directly to the individual owners entitled thereto. (

 received to their shareholders as a dividend, and accordingly, a refund directly to the shareholders was appropriate. This interest of the banks in the refunds was often palpably recognized by the State by making the checks out to both the bank and the shareholder with the bank then automatically endorsing the check over to its shareholders. That this formalism was not followed in the case before us is irrelevant to the actual existence of the petitioner\rquote s interest in, and hence \u8220\'3frecovery\u8221\'3f of, the refunded taxes.

Different considerations apply to that part of the refunded amounts representing interest on the ad valorem taxes paid by petitioner, i.e., the $587.47. Petitioner never deducted this amount. The tax benefit rule and section 111 cannot, therefore, apply. Petitioner was not in receipt of income with respect to the payment of this amount to its shareholders.

The amount of this claimed deficiency was based on respondent\rquote s determination that petitioner had understated its income by $27,383.16. The parties have stipulated that respondent was in error to the extent of $685.37. Thus the amount of understatement that respondent now claims is $26,697.79 which consists of $26,110.32 in taxes paid by pettitioner on behalf of its individual shareholders, plus $587.47 in interest which accrued on, and was refunded with, these taxes.

We also note that petitioner does not appear to have objected to the refund to the shareholders without even its name being on the refund checks. We believe that petitioner\rquote s inaction was itself a means of obtaining the desired result. Petitioner, in effect, stood by and let this benefit flow to the natural objects of its bounty, i.e., its shareholders.
