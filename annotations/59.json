But the mere purchase for money of the assets of one Company by another is beyond the evident purpose of the provision, and has no real semblance to a merger or consolidation.

This much is necessary in order that the result accomplished may genuinely partake of the nature of merger or consolidation.\n\nGregory v. Helvering, 293 U.S. 465, revealed a sham \u2014 a mere device intended to obscure the character of the transaction. We, of course, disregarded the mask and dealt with realities. The present record discloses no such situation; nothing suggests other than a bona fide business move.\n\n386*386 The transaction here was no sale, but partook of the nature of a reorganization in that the seller acquired a definite and substantial interest in the purchaser.\n\nTrue it is that the relationship of the taxpayer to the assets conveyed was substantially changed, but this is not inhibited by the statute. Also, a large part of the consideration was cash. This, we think, is permissible so long as the taxpayer received an interest in the affairs of the transferee which represented a material part of the value of the transferred assets.\n\nFinally, it is said the transferror was not dissolved and therefore the transaction does not adequately resemble consolidation. But dissolution is not prescribed and we are unable to see that such action is essential to the end in view.\n\nThe challenged judgment is\n\nAffirmed.\n\nNos. 175 and 176.\n\nThe respondents in these cases are two of the three stockholders of Minnesota Tea Company. The writs were granted upon the Commissioner's petition, which states the question involved is whether the transaction between Minnesota Tea Company and Grand Union Company, described above \u2014 No. 174 \u2014 resulted in a reorganization within the Revenue Act of 1928. The petition also declared \u2014 \"The amount of the tax due from the respondents,. . . depends solely upon whether the transfer of the properties of the Minnesota Tea Company to the Grand Union Company was a reorganization within the meaning of the Revenue Act.\"\n\nWe think the court below rightly decided there was a reorganization. It reversed the Board of Tax Appeals and remanded the cause for further proceedings, and its judgment must be\n\nAffirmed."}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-07-14T06:23:51.508087Z", "updated_at": "2025-08-23T19:42:53.800204Z", "is_labeled": true, "overlap": 1, "inner_id": 126, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 1, "updated_by": 5, "file_upload": null, "comment_authors": []}, "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-08-23T19:42:53.641404Z", "updated_at": "2025-08-23T19:42:53.641415Z", "draft_created_at": "2025-08-22T21:51:53.041537Z", "lead_time": 79815.132, "import_id": null, "last_action": null, "bulk_created": false, "project": 1, "updated_by": 5, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}
