Respondents and Silent Automatic also undertook to refrain from manufacture or sale of oil burners for a period of five years beginning January 1, 1932.\n\nThe first question presented is whether the agreement and the transaction pursuant thereto constituted a taxfree reorganization under Section 112 (b) (4) and (d) (1) of the Revenue Act of 1928 or 1932, 26 U.S.C.

Expressing the view that a reorganization had not been consummated, Mr. Justice Roberts, after reviewing the decisions, said:\n\n\"We are of opinion that the term of the obligations is not material. Where the consideration is wholly in the transferee's bonds, or part cash and part such bonds, we think it cannot be said that the transferor retains any proprietary interest in the enterprise. On the contrary, he becomes a creditor of the transferee; and we do not think that the fact referred to by the Circuit Court of Appeals, that the bonds were secured solely by the assets transferred and that, upon default, the bondholder would retake only the property sold, changes his status from that of a creditor to one having a proprietary stake, within the purview of the statute.\n\n\"We conclude that the Circuit Court of Appeals was in error in holding that, as respects any of the property transferred to the Water Company, the transaction was other than a sale or exchange upon which gain or loss must be reckoned in accordance with the provisions of the revenue act dealing with the recognition of gain or loss upon a sale or exchange.\"\n\nWe think the transactions involved herein constituted a sale, and the Board of Tax Appeals erred in holding otherwise.\n\nThe Board of course did not consider when the sale took place, having erroneously reached the conclusion that there was none; and that question remains to be determined.\n\nRespondents take the position that we must affirm the Board's decision of no tax liability in 1932, if we conclude from the facts found that the sale occurred in 1931; but they contend that we cannot reverse and remand with proper directions if our conclusion is that the sale occurred in 1932, \u2014 even though the question was briefed and argued to us, and all the relevant evidence was before the Board and is in the record here. We are unimpressed with this argument. Decision as to when the gain was realized requires construction of a written contract and the applicable statutes in the light of undisputed facts. The ultimate question, if not solely one of law, is at least a mixed question of law and fact, and may properly be decided by a reviewing court. Commissioner v. Southern Bell T. & T. Co., 6 Cir., 102 F.2d 397; Washburn v. Commissioner, 8 Cir., 51 F. 2d 949.\n\nWe proceed to consider whether the sale occurred in 1931 or 1932.\n\nThere are no hard and fast rules of thumb that can be used in determining, for taxation purposes, when a sale was consummated, and no single factor is controlling; the transaction must be viewed as a whole and in the light of realism and practicality. Passage of title is perhaps the most conclusive circumstance. Brown Lumber Co. v. Commissioner, 59 App.D.C. 110, 35 F.2d 880. Transfer of possession is also significant. Helvering v. Nibley-Mimnaugh 710*710 Lumber Co., 63 App.D.C. 181, 70 F.2d 843; Commissioner v. Union Pac. R. Co., 2 Cir., 86 F.2d 637; Brunton v. Commissioner, 9 Cir., 42 F.2d 81. A factor often considered is whether there has been such substantial performance of conditions precedent as imposes upon the purchaser an unconditional duty to pay. Commissioner v. North Jersey Title Ins. Co., 3 Cir., 79 F.2d 492; Brunton v. Commissioner, supra; Case v. Commissioner, 9 Cir., 103 F.2d 283; United States v. Utah-Idaho Sugar Co., 10 Cir., 96 F.2d 756. See Options and Sale Contracts in Taxation, 46 Yale Law Jour. 272, 279.\n\nIn Lucas v. North Texas Lumber Co., 281 U.S. 11, 50 S.Ct. 184, 74 L.Ed. 668, a ten-day option to purchase timber lands was given to a solvent offeree on December 27, 1916. Having found the title satisfactory, the option holder on December 30 arranged for the money needed, gave notice of exercise of the option and declared itself ready to close the transaction and pay the purchase price \"as soon as the papers were prepared\"; and the offeror immediately ceased operating its saw mill and withdrew all its employees. Conveyance and payment of the purchase price followed on January 5, 1917. The vendor, reporting on the accrual basis, included the profit in its return for the year 1916. Mr. Justice Butler, holding this not proper, said: \"Respondent did not prepare the papers necessary to effect the transfer or make tender of title or possession or demand the purchase price in 1916. The title and right of possession remained in it until the transaction was closed. Consequently unconditional liability of vendee for the purchase price was not created in that year. * * * The entry of the purchase price in respondent's accounts as income in that year was not warranted. Respondent was not entitled to make return or have the tax computed on that basis, as clearly it did not reflect 1916 income.\"\n\nThe situation is analogous in the instant case. An executory contract was made on October 2, 1931. Some of the purchase price was then paid and a promissory note for broker's commission given, but the Timken Company did not have an unconditional right to the execution of the documents transferring title until it delivered or tendered the promised debentures on January 2, 1932; nor had Silent Automatic an unconditional right to the debentures until it had delivered or tendered the bills of sale contemplated. It follows, we think, under the doctrine of the Lucas case, that for taxation purposes the sale herein did not occur until January 2, 1932. See Folkerts v. Marysville Land Co., 236 Mich. 294, 210 N.W. 231.\n\nMoreover, we think this conclusion accords with the intention of the parties. An examination of the contract reveals that Silent Automatic agreed to transfer and Timken to acquire all of the former's assets, including those of the Sales Corporation \"as of January 2, 1932.\" These concurrent obligations were to be performed \"on January 2, 1932, or as soon thereafter as possible.\" Silent Automatic also agreed that it would \"diligently conduct its business in the usual manner\" until delivery, and Timken agreed to assume all notes and accounts payable as shown by the consolidated balance sheet of Silent Automatic and the Sales Corporation dated August 31, 1931, \"together with those currently accruing from August 31, 1931, to the effective date of delivery.\" The common stockholders of Silent Automatic were informed that Timken would acquire the assets of Silent Automatic as of January 2, 1932, subject to its liabilities. The stockholders of the Timken-Detroit Axle Company were notified not only that Timken and Silent Automatic would merge on January 2, 1932, but that they would continue to operate separately until that time. We think the parties themselves have interpreted this agreement as contemplating consummation on January 2, 1932. Their interpretation is entitled to great, if not controlling, weight. Switzer v. Pinconning Lumber Co., 59 Mich. 488, 26 N.W. 762.\n\nThe cases of Newaygo Portland Cement Co. v. Commissioner, 27 B.T.A. 1097, affirmed 64 App.D.C. 278, 77 F.2d 536, and Nibley-Mimnaugh Lumber Co. v. Commissioner, supra, relied upon by respondents, are not inconsistent with the conclusion we have reached.\n\nThe judgment of the Board of Tax Appeals is reversed and the cause remanded for further proceedings in accordance with the views expressed herein."}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-07-14T06:23:51.937149Z", "updated_at": "2025-08-22T21:27:34.945754Z", "is_labeled": true, "overlap": 1, "inner_id": 135, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 1, "updated_by": 5, "file_upload": null, "comment_authors": []}, "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-08-22T21:27:34.786005Z", "updated_at": "2025-08-22T21:27:34.786015Z", "draft_created_at": "2025-08-22T05:21:14.378319Z", "lead_time": 10717.028, "import_id": null, "last_action": null, "bulk_created": false, "project": 1, "updated_by": 5, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}
