By virtue of that election his sole proprietorship, Stanton Refractory Sales Company, was taxed as if it were a corporation. Stanton chose to terminate because Congress, in 1966, had repealed the provision in the Internal Revenue Code which had permitted the election. Act of April 14, 1966, Pub.L. No. 89-389, \u00a7 4, 80 Stat. 115, amending Int.Rev.Code \u00a7 1361 (now Int.Rev.Code \u00a7 1361(n)). The repealing legislation provided that any election not terminated on or before December 31, 1968 would be terminated by operation of law on January 1, 1969. Taxpayers were given the right to terminate Subchapter R elections voluntarily by the December 31st date.\\n\\nAlong with his decision to terminate, which was made as of November 1, 1966, Stanton decided to form a new corporation. This decision grew out of discussions he had had, prior to the termination date, with E. M. Harvey, President of North State Pyrophyllite Co., a North Carolina refractory manufacturer. The proprietorship was the exclusive sales representative for North State to both the United States and Canadian steel industries. The discussions dealt with the desirability of incorporating so that there would be continuity in the operation of the business in the event of Stanton's death. Harvey had expressed the preference that Mrs. Wanda Stanton, who was an active participant in the business of the proprietorship, have an ownership interest in any corporation that might be formed. But there were other motivations for incorporation unrelated to Mrs. Stanton.[3]\\n\\nAs planned, Stanton was to transfer some, but not all, of the assets of the Subchapter R proprietorship to the new corporation, and Mrs. Stanton was to receive 49% of the newly-issued stock. This was precisely how the new corporation was formed. On November 1, 1966, the date of the Subchapter R termination, 15*15 Stanton caused the incorporation of Stanton Refractories, Inc., and transferred the operating assets of the proprietorship to it. The stock of the corporation was issued 51% to Mr. Stanton and 49% to Mrs. Stanton. The opening balance sheet of the corporation, as of November 1, 1966, reflected the following:\\n\\nASSETS\\nCash $ 8,261.83\\nAccounts Receivable 4,263.97\\nInventory 39,144.74\\nFurniture and Equipment\\n(Net of depreciation) 10,242.75\\nInsurance Deposit 140.00\\nTelephone Deposit 100.00\\n__________\\nTOTAL ASSETS $62,153.29\\n==========\\nLIABILITIES:\\n\\nAccounts Payable $50,406.33\\nAccrued Taxes 1,746.96\\nNet Equity\\nCapital Stock $10,000\\nRetained Earnings 0\\n_______\\n10,000.00\\nTOTAL LIABILITIES $62,153.29\\n==========\\nThe consideration for the $10,000 in capital stock came entirely from the assets transferred from the Subchapter R proprietorship. As of October 31, 1966, the balance sheet of the Subchapter R proprietorship was as follows:\\n\\nASSETS\\nCash $122,314.41\\nAccounts Receivable 45,561.18\\nInventory 39,144.74\\nFurniture and Equipment\\n(Net of depreciation) 10,242.75\\nInsurance Deposit 140.00\\nTelephone Deposit 100.00\\n___________\\nTOTAL ASSETS $217,503.08\\n===========\\nLIABILITIES\\nAccounts Payable $ 50,406.33\\nAccrued Payroll Taxes 1,746.96\\nProvision for Federal Income\\nTaxes 4,933.52\\nEquity:\\nPaid-In Capital $22,067.54\\nRetained Earnings 138,348.73\\n160,416.27\\n__________\\nTOTAL LIABILITIES $217,503.08\\n===========\\n16*16 Thus the effect of the termination of the election was that the corporation received all the proprietorship's furniture and equipment, its deposits and inventory and sufficient cash and accounts receivable, such that the value of these assets equalled the value of the accounts payable and accrued payroll taxes assumed plus the value of the capital stock. Stanton retained $114,052.58 in cash and $41,297.21 in accounts receivable, and assumed liability for Subchapter R federal income taxes in the amount of $4933.52. On their 1966 return the taxpayers reported a long term capital gain on the liquidation of the Subchapter R proprietorship in the amount of $138,348.73. This sum was equal to the retained earnings of the proprietorship, an amount we note was the equivalent of the earned surplus of a corporation. Stanton's basis for the assets of the proprietorship was $22,067.54, an amount which was the equivalent of the paid-in capital of a corporation. The Internal Revenue Service treated the transaction as resulting in a taxable dividend in the amount of the claimed capital gain and assessed a deficiency of $48,104.65 in income tax for the year 1966.

They rely on Int.Rev.Code \u00a7 1361(l) which provides:\n\n\"A distribution in partial or complete liquidation with respect to a proprietorship or partnership interest by an enterprise as to which an election has been made under subsection (a), shall be treated as a corporate liquidation in accordance with part II of sub-chapter C [\u00a7\u00a7 331-346] of this chapter.\"\nTreatment as a liquidation under Int. Rev.Code \u00a7 331 would result in a long term capital gain in the amount reported. The government concedes that this would have been the effect of the termination of election prior to the enactment of the repealing legislation if a termination had then been possible. A major reason for the repeal of Subchapter R was that sole proprietorships were not often exercising the option. 7 CCH 1975 Stand.Fed.Tax Rep. \u00b6 4845A.01. This in turn was probably because the tax-free reorganization provisions of the Code were practically unavailable to electing proprietors who wanted to change to the corporate form of doing business. See Estate of Wein v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 330 F.2d 957 (3d Cir. 1964), aff'g 40 T.C. 454 (1963). As originally structured \u00a7 1361(m) provided that, with stated exceptions, an enterprise as to which a Subchapter R election had been made could not be considered a corporation, nor its proprietors nor partners be considered shareholders, for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code provisions relating to corporate reorganizations. The 1966 legislation repealed \u00a7 1361(m). The legislative history makes clear that terminations of Subchapter R elections made on or after April 14, 1966, the date of enactment, and before the cut-off date of January 1, 1969, were intended to be covered by the reorganization provisions of the Code.[4] A Subchapter R enterprise could have been liquidated, as if it were an actual corporation, and the proceeds in liquidation would have been afforded capital gains treatment pursuant to Int.Rev.Code \u00a7 331. The enterprise could have been transferred completely in a tax-free reorganization to a corporation controlled by the old owners. 17*17 But, just as in the case of a corporation, the owners of a Subchapter R enterprise could not achieve the transfer of that enterprise to a corporation controlled by them while at the same time distributing earned surplus at capital gains rates. The government contends that the November 1, 1966 transactions were a reorganization within the meaning of Int. Rev.Code \u00a7 356 and that the property retained by Stanton was \"boot\". In a reorganization this \"boot\" is taxable as ordinary income at least to the extent it represents earned surplus.\n\nThe taxpayers, recognizing that a liquidation of a Subchapter R enterprise followed by a transfer of the enterprise to a corporation controlled by the former owner may, since April 4, 1966, be classified as a corporate reorganization, urge that the November 1, 1966 transactions were nevertheless a liquidation-reincorporation rather than a reorganization. The argument is based on the contention that the transactions did not meet any of the reorganization definitions set out in Int.Rev.Code \u00a7 368. This position was accepted by the district court. It rejected the government's principal contention[5] that the transactions constituted a reorganization as defined in Int. Rev.Code \u00a7 368(a)(1)(D). That subsection reads as follows:\n\n\"[A] transfer by a corporation of all or a part of its assets to another corporation if immediately after the transfer the transferor, or one or more of its shareholders (including persons who were shareholders immediately before the transfer), or any combination thereof, is in control of the corporation to which the assets are transferred; but only if, in pursuance of the plan, stock or securities of the corporation to which the assets are transferred are distributed in a transaction which qualifies under section 354, 355, or 356 [is a reorganization].\"\nThe court held that Mrs. Stanton's ownership of 49% of the stock of the new corporate enterprise, Stanton Refractories, Inc. prevented Stanton from having the requisite 80% control of that enterprise as required by the definition of \"control\" found in Int.Rev.Code \u00a7 368(c):\n\n\"For purposes of part I (other than section 304), part II, and this part, the term `control' means the ownership of stock possessing at least 80 percent of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote and at least 80 percent of the total number of shares of all other classes of stock of the corporation.\"\nThe district court emphasized the undisputed fact that Stanton had a sound business purpose for giving his wife, an active participant in his business, a percentage of stock which would reassure his supplier of her continued participation. But in looking only at the percentage of ownership which resulted from that gift, the court disregarded what the government contends is the controlling reality; that at the time of the transfer of the operating assets from the Subchapter R enterprise to the new enterprise Stanton had the absolute right to designate who would receive all the stock. That his business judgment strongly suggested the wisdom of a gift of 49% to his wife in no way lessened his control.\n\nA closely analogous case is American Bantam Car Co. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 177 F.2d 513 (3d Cir. 1949), affirming per curiam and adopting the reasoning of 11 T.C. 397 (1948).[6] In that case the transfer of assets to a new corporation for 300,000 shares of stock took place on June 3, 1936. Five days later the new corporation executed an underwriting agreement pursuant to which the underwriters would receive up to 100,000 shares of the shareholders' common stock as and if preferred stock was sold. The underwriters received 87,900 18*18 shares of common stock by October 1937. The Tax Court held that in June 1936 the stockholders had the requisite control even though prior to the transfer of assets it was contemplated that a preferred stock underwriting would be attempted. The reality was that as of June 1936 the stockholders could have called off the underwriting. Thus there was a tax-free reorganization.\n\nAnother closely analogous case is Wilgard Realty Co. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 127 F.2d 514 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 317 U.S. 655, 63 S.Ct. 52, 87 L.Ed. 527 (1942). There the transferor acquired all the stock of a new corporation. It was his intention to give away three-fourths of that stock to members of his family on the same day as he received it and after the transfer of assets took place. The gifts were, in fact, made. The court held that a tax-free exchange had taken place:\n\n\"In the absence of any restriction upon his freedom of action after he acquired the stock, he had `immediately after the exchange' as much control of the petitioner as if he had not before made up his mind to give away most of his stock and consequently his control.\" Id. at 516.\nSee also Manhattan Building Co., 27 T.C. 1032 (1957); B. Bittker & J. Eustice, Federal Income Taxation of Corporations and Shareholders \u00b6 3.10 (3d ed. 1971).\n\nTaxpayers rely heavily on Fahs v. Florida Machine & Foundry Co., 168 F.2d 957 (5th Cir.1948). That case is clearly distinguishable. The issue was the transferee corporation's basis for certain real estate it had sold. If it had acquired the real estate in a tax-free exchange it had the same basis as the transferor, rather than the higher basis for which it contended. Whether the exchange was tax-free depended, in turn, on whether one of two stockholders was in control when the transfer was made. The stockholders were father and son. The father owned a machine shop conducted as a proprietorship. Its assets included the real estate. In 1921, in order to induce the son, an engineer, to stay with the business, the father entered into an agreement whereby the son would eventually receive a one-half interest if he did stay. In 1924, and pursuant to that agreement, the transferee corporation was formed. The father transferred all the proprietorship assets to it, and the stock was issued one-half to him and the other half (except for 3 qualifying shares) to the son. The government contended that the father was in control. The Fifth Circuit held:\n\n\"We are of [the] opinion the district court's finding that Franklin Russell, Senior, was not in `control' of taxpayer corporation `immediately after the transfer' on July 16, 1924 and therefore, that Section 112(b)(5) did not apply, is abundantly supported by the evidence.\" Id. at 959.\nThe evidence, of course, was that unlike Stanton, Franklin Russell, Sr. had undertaken by a contract supported by consideration, prior to the transfer, to give his son one-half the business. Thus he did not at the time of the transfer have the absolute right to designate who would receive all the stock in the transferee. That distinction suffices, and we need not consider whether, as the government contends, Fahs was erroneously decided since Franklin Russell, Jr. was in practical effect, a 50% owner of the transferred enterprise. That would, of course, have caused the aggregation of his and his father's control, and have made the reorganization tax-free. Even if the record supported a finding that prior to November 1, 1966 Mrs. Stanton had acquired in some binding manner a 49% interest in the transferred enterprise (and nothing in the record so suggests) we would be inclined to agree with the government that in such case her interest and that of her husband would be aggregated for purposes of \u00a7 368(c).\n\nWe recognize that by attempting to ameliorate the lot of one group of unwary Subchapter R taxpayers Congress, 19*19 in repealing Int.Rev.Code \u00a7 1361, erected a snare for another in which the Stantons became enmeshed. The taxpayer could, however, have liquidated his Subchapter R enterprise with long term capital gain consequences had he foregone the benefits of carrying on the same enterprise in corporate form. He could also have transferred all of the assets of the enterprise to a successor corporation in a tax-free reorganization. He could not, following such a transfer, have distributed earned surplus at long term capital gain rates. The \"boot\" provisions in the reorganization sections of the Code are designed to prevent the equivalent of such a distribution in connection with partial transfers in reorganization.\n\nThe judgment of the district court will be reversed."}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-07-14T06:23:52.034639Z", "updated_at": "2025-08-23T23:21:59.745024Z", "is_labeled": true, "overlap": 1, "inner_id": 137, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 1, "updated_by": 5, "file_upload": null, "comment_authors": []}, "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-08-23T23:21:59.578128Z", "updated_at": "2025-08-23T23:21:59.578141Z", "draft_created_at": "2025-08-23T22:59:28.051798Z", "lead_time": 2411.637, "import_id": null, "last_action": null, "bulk_created": false, "project": 1, "updated_by": 5, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}
