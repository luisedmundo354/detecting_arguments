  <TR><TD ALIGN="left" WIDTH="150">During 1954, Plaintiff-Taxpayer acquired<BR ALIGN='left'/>an interest in approximately 3925 acres<BR ALIGN='left'/>of land known as the Westmoreland<BR ALIGN='left'/>property. Shortly thereafter he conveyed<BR ALIGN='left'/>approximately 297 acres of this land to<BR ALIGN='left'/>Sharpstown Development Company<BR ALIGN='left'/>(hereinafter referred to as<BR ALIGN='left'/>&quot;Development&quot;), a corporation organized<BR ALIGN='left'/>in 1954, in which Plaintiff owned a<BR ALIGN='left'/>fifty per cent stock interest. The<BR ALIGN='left'/>balance of approximately 3628 acres was<BR ALIGN='left'/>conveyed to a second corporation known<BR ALIGN='left'/>as Sharpstown Investment Company<BR ALIGN='left'/>(hereinafter referred to as<BR ALIGN='left'/>&quot;Investment&quot;), which was organized in<BR ALIGN='left'/>1954 and in which Plaintiff also owned a<BR ALIGN='left'/>fifty per cent stock interest. The<BR ALIGN='left'/>remaining common stock of both<BR ALIGN='left'/>Development and Investment was held in<BR ALIGN='left'/>identical proportions by various members<BR ALIGN='left'/>of the Farnsworth family and the<BR ALIGN='left'/>Chambers family. The 297 acres conveyed<BR ALIGN='left'/>to Development was developed as Section<BR ALIGN='left'/>One of the Sharpstown Subdivision. Of<BR ALIGN='left'/>the land acquired by Investment, 335.3<BR ALIGN='left'/>acres were sold to Development during<BR ALIGN='left'/>the fiscal year ending September 30,<BR ALIGN='left'/>1956, and was thereafter known as<BR ALIGN='left'/>Section Two of Sharpstown Subdivision.<BR ALIGN='left'/>No other real property was sold by<BR ALIGN='left'/>Investment to Development during the<BR ALIGN='left'/>existence of those corporations. With<BR ALIGN='left'/>minor exceptions, all real property sold<BR ALIGN='left'/>by Investment throughout its existence<BR ALIGN='left'/>was from the property referred to above<BR ALIGN='left'/>as the Westmoreland property. Also with<BR ALIGN='left'/>minor exceptions, all lots sold by<BR ALIGN='left'/>Development throughout its existence<BR ALIGN='left'/>were lots located within Sections One<BR ALIGN='left'/>and Two of Sharpstown Subdivision.\n\nIn<BR ALIGN='left'/>the early part of 1958 the Farnsworth<BR ALIGN='left'/>and Chambers families encountered<BR ALIGN='left'/>outside financial difficulties and<BR ALIGN='left'/>wanted to get out of the corporations,<BR ALIGN='left'/>which were in severe financial straits.<BR ALIGN='left'/>The shareholders contributed their<BR ALIGN='left'/>Investment stock to Development on<BR ALIGN='left'/>February 27, 1958. It was also apparent<BR ALIGN='left'/>that much of the land owned by<BR ALIGN='left'/>Investment would have to be sold in<BR ALIGN='left'/>order to meet the obligations of the<BR ALIGN='left'/>corporations. On March 24, 1958,<BR ALIGN='left'/>Investment sold to the Plaintiff for a<BR ALIGN='left'/>recited consideration of $500.00 an<BR ALIGN='left'/>option to purchase 2376.82 acres of the<BR ALIGN='left'/>Westmoreland property for $8,100,000.00.<BR ALIGN='left'/>The option ran from November 1, 1958,<BR ALIGN='left'/>through March 24, 1960.\n\nThrough the<BR ALIGN='left'/>Plaintiff&#x27;s efforts, buyers were found<BR ALIGN='left'/>and on April 11, 1958, Investment sold<BR ALIGN='left'/>the same 2376.82 acres of the<BR ALIGN='left'/>Westmoreland property covered by<BR ALIGN='left'/>Plaintiff&#x27;s option, to Messrs. Smith and<BR ALIGN='left'/>Neuhaus for a total purchase price of<BR ALIGN='left'/>$5,000,000.00, subject to the option.<BR ALIGN='left'/>During April, 1958, Investment sold<BR ALIGN='left'/>substantially all of its remaining<BR ALIGN='left'/>properties to parties other than<BR ALIGN='left'/>Development, the sales totaling 2956.28<BR ALIGN='left'/>acres.\n\n887*887 On October 16, 1958,<BR ALIGN='left'/>Sharpstown Realty (hereinafter referred<BR ALIGN='left'/>to as &quot;Realty&quot;) was incorporated with<BR ALIGN='left'/>capital of $1,000.00 represented by one<BR ALIGN='left'/>thousand shares of common stock with a<BR ALIGN='left'/>par value of $1.00 per share. At all<BR ALIGN='left'/>times relevant hereto the common stock<BR ALIGN='left'/>of Realty was owned one hundred per cent<BR ALIGN='left'/>by the Plaintiff and members of his<BR ALIGN='left'/>immediate family, and, except for the<BR ALIGN='left'/>Plaintiff, no shareholder of Investment<BR ALIGN='left'/>or Development owned any of the common<BR ALIGN='left'/>stock of Realty.\n\nOn November 25,<BR ALIGN='left'/>1958, Plaintiff transferred to Realty<BR ALIGN='left'/>the option he had purchased from<BR ALIGN='left'/>Investment with respect to all but four<BR ALIGN='left'/>tracts which were transferred to Realty<BR ALIGN='left'/>on December 14, 1959. Investment was<BR ALIGN='left'/>liquidated under State law on July 14,<BR ALIGN='left'/>1959, pursuant to a resolution adopted<BR ALIGN='left'/>on June 23, 1959. Its assets and<BR ALIGN='left'/>liabilities were transferred to<BR ALIGN='left'/>Development, and its common stock was<BR ALIGN='left'/>surrendered and canceled. On the same<BR ALIGN='left'/>date Development was liquidated under<BR ALIGN='left'/>State law pursuant to a resolution<BR ALIGN='left'/>adopted on June 19, 1959. Its assets and<BR ALIGN='left'/>some of its liabilities were distributed<BR ALIGN='left'/>to its shareholders as of that date,<BR ALIGN='left'/>except for the sum of $60,000.00 which<BR ALIGN='left'/>was retained by Development to pay its<BR ALIGN='left'/>remaining liabilities. Thereafter<BR ALIGN='left'/>through 1962 all remaining liabilities<BR ALIGN='left'/>were paid and the balance of the fund<BR ALIGN='left'/>retained was distributed to the<BR ALIGN='left'/>shareholders by the end of the calendar<BR ALIGN='left'/>year 1962, at which time the common<BR ALIGN='left'/>stock of Development was surrendered and<BR ALIGN='left'/>canceled. After July 14, 1959,<BR ALIGN='left'/>Investment and Development conducted no<BR ALIGN='left'/>further business except to complete the<BR ALIGN='left'/>distribution of assets in<BR ALIGN='left'/>dissolution.\n\nPursuant to the<BR ALIGN='left'/>dissolution agreement, Plaintiff<BR ALIGN='left'/>received certain non-cash assets of<BR ALIGN='left'/>Development with a net value of<BR ALIGN='left'/>$53,918.88 which he sold to Realty for<BR ALIGN='left'/>that amount. He also received cash in<BR ALIGN='left'/>the amount of $72,628.34.[1]\n\nOn July<BR ALIGN='left'/>31, 1959, Plaintiff increased the<BR ALIGN='left'/>capital of Realty to $50,000.00, and<BR ALIGN='left'/>forty-nine thousand additional shares of<BR ALIGN='left'/>common stock were issued with a par<BR ALIGN='left'/>value of $1.00 per share.\n\nDuring the<BR ALIGN='left'/>period from November, 1958, through<BR ALIGN='left'/>July, 1959, Realty purchased<BR ALIGN='left'/>approximately 57 acres of land under the<BR ALIGN='left'/>option acquired from Plaintiff, and<BR ALIGN='left'/>during the years 1958, 1959 and 1960<BR ALIGN='left'/>Realty exercised the option with respect<BR ALIGN='left'/>to all but 65.056 acres of the land<BR ALIGN='left'/>covered by the option agreement, paying<BR ALIGN='left'/>in total approximately $7,500,000.00 to<BR ALIGN='left'/>Messrs. Smith and Neuhaus to acquire the<BR ALIGN='left'/>property.\n\nOn his federal income tax<BR ALIGN='left'/>return for the calendar year 1959,<BR ALIGN='left'/>Plaintiff reported long-term capital<BR ALIGN='left'/>gain of $76,547.23 as a result of the<BR ALIGN='left'/>distribution received from Development,<BR ALIGN='left'/>and paid the appropriate tax thereon.<BR ALIGN='left'/>This sum was computed by subtracting the<BR ALIGN='left'/>Plaintiff&#x27;s basis in the Development<BR ALIGN='left'/>stock of $50,000.00 from the total<BR ALIGN='left'/>received in liquidation during 1959 of<BR ALIGN='left'/>$126,547.23.\n\nUpon audit, the Internal<BR ALIGN='left'/>Revenue Service determined that the<BR ALIGN='left'/>transaction was 888*888 in substance a<BR ALIGN='left'/>reorganization and that Plaintiff<BR ALIGN='left'/>realized $118,834.68 of ordinary<BR ALIGN='left'/>dividend income as a result of the<BR ALIGN='left'/>dissolution distribution.</TD></TR>
