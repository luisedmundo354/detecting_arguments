  <TR><TD ALIGN="left" WIDTH="150">For many years prior to April 1, 1933,<BR ALIGN='left'/>appellee owned 416 shares of the 800<BR ALIGN='left'/>outstanding shares of the capital stock<BR ALIGN='left'/>of The Insurance Field Company, a<BR ALIGN='left'/>Kentucky corporation with its principal<BR ALIGN='left'/>place of business in Louisville,<BR ALIGN='left'/>Kentucky, and herein referred to as the<BR ALIGN='left'/>&quot;old company.&quot; The main business of the<BR ALIGN='left'/>Field Company was the publication of The<BR ALIGN='left'/>Insurance Field Magazine. The company<BR ALIGN='left'/>also sold supplies to insurance agencies<BR ALIGN='left'/>and companies, and published books on<BR ALIGN='left'/>various subjects pertaining to<BR ALIGN='left'/>insurance, as well as various accounting<BR ALIGN='left'/>forms. It had no printing facilities,<BR ALIGN='left'/>and whatever business of this kind it<BR ALIGN='left'/>procured was turned over to appellee<BR ALIGN='left'/>Courier-Journal Job Printing Company.<BR ALIGN='left'/>The Field Company also had an agreement<BR ALIGN='left'/>with appellee whereby the latter sold<BR ALIGN='left'/>materials to certain insurance<BR ALIGN='left'/>companies, in the name of the Field<BR ALIGN='left'/>Company, in whose name the account was<BR ALIGN='left'/>billed. Formerly, commissions were paid<BR ALIGN='left'/>by appellee to the old company on this<BR ALIGN='left'/>business, but payment of such<BR ALIGN='left'/>commissions was terminated after<BR ALIGN='left'/>1932.\n\nOn April 1, 1933, the corporate<BR ALIGN='left'/>charter of the Field Company expired,<BR ALIGN='left'/>although its officers, as well as the<BR ALIGN='left'/>officers of appellee, were not aware of<BR ALIGN='left'/>that fact and did not have it brought to<BR ALIGN='left'/>their attention until early in the year<BR ALIGN='left'/>of 1934. Under Kentucky law, expiration<BR ALIGN='left'/>of a corporate charter requires a<BR ALIGN='left'/>winding up of the affairs of the<BR ALIGN='left'/>corporation.\n\nOn March 29, 1934,<BR ALIGN='left'/>articles were executed for the<BR ALIGN='left'/>incorporation of a new company under the<BR ALIGN='left'/>name of The Insurance Field Company,<BR ALIGN='left'/>herein referred to for convenience as<BR ALIGN='left'/>the &quot;new company.&quot; The officers and<BR ALIGN='left'/>directors of the old company sought to<BR ALIGN='left'/>bring about a continuance of the<BR ALIGN='left'/>business by having the new company offer<BR ALIGN='left'/>to the stockholders of the old company<BR ALIGN='left'/>the same number of shares in the new<BR ALIGN='left'/>company as each had held in the old<BR ALIGN='left'/>company; and it was proposed that the<BR ALIGN='left'/>new company should receive all of the<BR ALIGN='left'/>assets of the old company and assume its<BR ALIGN='left'/>liabilities. However, one of the<BR ALIGN='left'/>stockholders in the old company, owning<BR ALIGN='left'/>72 shares of stock, declined to<BR ALIGN='left'/>participate in the reorganization and<BR ALIGN='left'/>demanded that the old company be<BR ALIGN='left'/>liquidated. The proposed plan was<BR ALIGN='left'/>thereafter abandoned; and appellee then<BR ALIGN='left'/>purchased the 72 shares of the<BR ALIGN='left'/>recalcitrant stockholder for $2,400.<BR ALIGN='left'/>During 1934, 302 shares of stock of the<BR ALIGN='left'/>old corporation, which had been<BR ALIGN='left'/>purchased by employees 822*822 on<BR ALIGN='left'/>credit, were canceled, and the purchase<BR ALIGN='left'/>money notes surrendered, by agreement<BR ALIGN='left'/>between the company and such employees.<BR ALIGN='left'/>With this cancellation of stock, the<BR ALIGN='left'/>original number of 800 shares was<BR ALIGN='left'/>reduced to 498 shares. Appellee, having<BR ALIGN='left'/>originally owned 416 shares, and having<BR ALIGN='left'/>purchased the additional 72 shares, was,<BR ALIGN='left'/>accordingly, the owner of 488 shares of<BR ALIGN='left'/>the 498 shares outstanding, for which it<BR ALIGN='left'/>had paid $44,000. Appellee company,<BR ALIGN='left'/>which was the chief creditor of the old<BR ALIGN='left'/>corporation, wished to avoid the<BR ALIGN='left'/>liquidation of the business of that<BR ALIGN='left'/>company and, in order to avoid this<BR ALIGN='left'/>eventuality, made plans to effect the<BR ALIGN='left'/>carrying on of the business as formerly.<BR ALIGN='left'/>To this end, in November, 1934, the<BR ALIGN='left'/>assets of the old company were appraised<BR ALIGN='left'/>and an audit made, which showed that the<BR ALIGN='left'/>old company was indebted to the appellee<BR ALIGN='left'/>in the amount of $68,050.39. In<BR ALIGN='left'/>addition, it owed to other creditors,<BR ALIGN='left'/>the sum of $3,119.83. Its assets were<BR ALIGN='left'/>valued at $32,640.67, no value being<BR ALIGN='left'/>placed upon &quot;goodwill.&quot;\n\nOn December<BR ALIGN='left'/>10, 1934, at a meeting of the<BR ALIGN='left'/>stockholders of the old company, a<BR ALIGN='left'/>resolution was adopted, in which its<BR ALIGN='left'/>assets were transferred to appellee in<BR ALIGN='left'/>consideration of appellee&#x27;s discharging<BR ALIGN='left'/>the old company&#x27;s existing indebtedness<BR ALIGN='left'/>to creditors (other than that of<BR ALIGN='left'/>appellee), in the amount of $3,119.83 —<BR ALIGN='left'/>and applying upon the old company&#x27;s debt<BR ALIGN='left'/>of $67,251.15 of that date, the value of<BR ALIGN='left'/>its assets in the amount of $29,520.84.<BR ALIGN='left'/>This left an unpaid balance of<BR ALIGN='left'/>$37,730.31 due appellee. The directors<BR ALIGN='left'/>and officers of the old company were<BR ALIGN='left'/>authorized to wind up its business and<BR ALIGN='left'/>to transfer its assets to the appellee;<BR ALIGN='left'/>and, thereafter, a meeting of the<BR ALIGN='left'/>directors of the old company adopted the<BR ALIGN='left'/>same resolution.\n\nFollowing the<BR ALIGN='left'/>meeting of the stockholders of the old<BR ALIGN='left'/>company, the stockholders of the new<BR ALIGN='left'/>company met and adopted a resolution<BR ALIGN='left'/>which provided that in consideration of<BR ALIGN='left'/>the transfer by the appellee of the<BR ALIGN='left'/>assets of the old company, which it had<BR ALIGN='left'/>received, to the new company, the latter<BR ALIGN='left'/>would cause to be issued to appellee 499<BR ALIGN='left'/>shares of its capital stock, at a<BR ALIGN='left'/>valuation of $59.16 per share, or at a<BR ALIGN='left'/>total valuation of $29,520.84; and that<BR ALIGN='left'/>appellee would discharge the debts of<BR ALIGN='left'/>the old company, excepting the old<BR ALIGN='left'/>company&#x27;s obligation to the appellee.<BR ALIGN='left'/>The Board of Directors of the new<BR ALIGN='left'/>company thereafter adopted the same<BR ALIGN='left'/>resolution.\n\nWith minor exceptions,<BR ALIGN='left'/>the stockholders and directors in the<BR ALIGN='left'/>old and new corporations were the same.<BR ALIGN='left'/>Appellee transferred the assets it had<BR ALIGN='left'/>received from the old corporation to the<BR ALIGN='left'/>new corporation, which proceeded to<BR ALIGN='left'/>continue the former business of the old<BR ALIGN='left'/>company with the same customers and the<BR ALIGN='left'/>same assets. The result of these<BR ALIGN='left'/>transactions was that appellee&#x27;s stock<BR ALIGN='left'/>holdings in the old corporation became<BR ALIGN='left'/>valueless, and the balance of its debt<BR ALIGN='left'/>against the old corporation was<BR ALIGN='left'/>uncollectible. The new corporation<BR ALIGN='left'/>became the owner of the assets of the<BR ALIGN='left'/>old corporation. The stock in the new<BR ALIGN='left'/>corporation was owned by appellee. The<BR ALIGN='left'/>old corporation was liquidated. Its<BR ALIGN='left'/>stock was worthless; it had no assets,<BR ALIGN='left'/>and claims against it were<BR ALIGN='left'/>worthless.\n\nIn its income tax return<BR ALIGN='left'/>for the year 1934, appellee claimed a<BR ALIGN='left'/>deduction for the unpaid balance of its<BR ALIGN='left'/>account against the old company, as a<BR ALIGN='left'/>bad debt, ascertained to be worthless<BR ALIGN='left'/>and charged off within the taxable year.<BR ALIGN='left'/>Appellee claimed a further deduction of<BR ALIGN='left'/>$44,000 for the loss which it had<BR ALIGN='left'/>sustained on its stock holdings in the<BR ALIGN='left'/>old company, predicated on the fact that<BR ALIGN='left'/>the shares of stock which it then held<BR ALIGN='left'/>in the old company were entirely<BR ALIGN='left'/>worthless. The Commissioner disallowed<BR ALIGN='left'/>both deductions, ruling that appellee<BR ALIGN='left'/>had not suffered any loss during the<BR ALIGN='left'/>year 1934, by reason either of its<BR ALIGN='left'/>account receivable against the old<BR ALIGN='left'/>company or its ownership of stock<BR ALIGN='left'/>therein; and further, that, even if such<BR ALIGN='left'/>a loss had been sustained, it was not<BR ALIGN='left'/>deductible because it was incurred in a<BR ALIGN='left'/>transaction which was a reorganization<BR ALIGN='left'/>of the old company and, therefore, was<BR ALIGN='left'/>not properly a deduction under the<BR ALIGN='left'/>Revenue Act of 1934.</TD></TR>
