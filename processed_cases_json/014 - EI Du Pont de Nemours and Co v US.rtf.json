    "Background": "\n\n\n\n1978 WL 3449 (Ct.Cl.)\nUnited States Court of Claims.\nE. I. Du Pont de Nemours and Company\nv.\nThe United States.\nNos. 256–66 & 371–66\n|\nApril 18, 1978.\n\n\nPER CURIAM\n\nOpinion*\n*1 The question that remains for decision in these multi-issue consolidated cases is whether, for the years 1959 and 1960, plaintiff has shown by a preponderance of the evidence, or as a matter of law, that the prices at which it transferred goods to Du Pont de Nemours International S. A. (DISA), the wholly owned Swiss marketing subsidiary that it formed in 1959 and interposed between itself and the independent overseas distributors with whom it had previously dealt directly, were the substantial equivalent of the prices that plaintiff, dealing at arm’s length, would have charged an unrelated party performing DISA’s functions under similar circumstances.\n \nAlthough organized in February 1959, DISA did not begin commercial operations until September 1 of that year.\n \nDuring the last 4 months of 1959 and the full year of 1960, plaintiff transferred products to DISA at prices that permitted the latter to realize a gross profit of almost $32 million on net sales (to independent purchasers, principally plaintiff’s distributors) of slightly more than $123 million. As contrasted with that gross profit, DISA incurred operating expenses totaling less than $8.5 million, leaving it with a net profit for the entire period of almost $20.5 million.\n \nOn audit examination of plaintiff’s 1959 and 1960 returns, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue concluded that the prices at which plaintiff had transferred its products to DISA were unrealistically low. Invoking the authority of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954,1 he proceeded to effectively increase those prices by reallocating to plaintiff approximately $18 million of the gross income that DISA had realized as a result of the pricing arrangement employed. That action produced tax deficiencies of more than $9 million that were duly assessed against plaintiff. After payment, plaintiff filed claims for refund and 6 months thereafter, the Commissioner having taken no formal action on those claims, brought the present suits for refund.\n \nOpting for an all-or-nothing result, plaintiff’s disagreement here does not go to the amount of DISA’s gross income that the Commissioner reallocated to it. Its contention, instead, is that no reallocation whatever was warranted. In that respect, plaintiff’s approach is the same as that once chosen by another taxpayer attacking an assessment under section 482 in this court. Eli Lilly & Co. v. United States [67–1 USTC ¶9248], 178 Ct. Cl. 666, 372 F. 2d 990 (1967).\n \n*2 In a previous proceeding that also involved the plaintiff, the distinguished Judge Sylvester J. Ryan, referring to a considerably lesser overall quantity of exhibits and transcript than that generated in the trial of these cases, observed: ‘* * * too many and too much.’ United States v. Imperial Chemical Industries Ltd., 100 F. Supp. 504, 513 (S. D. N. Y. 1951). Although a similar comment is in order here, it appears that the responsibility for excess lies more with the clients than their respective counsel. Plaintiff’s trial counsel, the third set of attorneys who have appeared for it in this proceeding, were associated only after extensive discovery and pretrial proceedings had as a practical matter fixed the substantive contours of its litigating position Given those constraints, they have made the most of what they had at their disposal. For its part, defendant’s efforts have been diffused by an understandable but unhelpful disinclination to come squarely to grips with plaintiff’s principal contention, viz, that it is entitled to prevail because of the dictates of certain language in the Commissioner’s regulations under section 482.\n \nWhile it it recognized that the inquiry in determining an arm’s-length price in any given situation is necessarily factual in nature, the parties’ (especially defendant’s) voluminous proposals and counter-proposals for findings of fact, in all amounting to 673 pages, do little to pinpoint the particular evidence that bears directly and significantly on the issue to be decided.\n \nThe 139 separately numbered findings of fact accompanying this opinion are intended to encompass all of the facts, both primary and subsidiary, that account for the conclusion reached. Reiteration in this opinion would serve only the interest of the printer.\n \nMost of plaintiff’s important witnesses were its own officers and employees. Almost without exception, they were highly credible and refreshingly forthright. Those qualities materially eased the chore of sorting out the really pertinent facts.\n \nAlthough plaintiff was the world’s largest chemical company in 1957, when the Common Market was established by the Treaty of Rome, it found itself in that era with a decreasing volume of sales in the United States, where it had traditionally concentrated its manufacturing and marketing efforts. At the same time, even though (except for interests in certain subsidiaries and affiliates located in the Western Hemisphere) it operated overseas only through a network of independent distributors, its export sales of output not needed to service the domestic market were increasing annually and were doing so at prices generally more profitable than it was able to obtain on its domestic business.\n \nIn these circumstances, and with Europe becoming a unified trading area approximating the United States in population size, Mr. Crawford H. Greenewalt, plaintiff’s president and chairman of its Executive Committee, saw the Common Market as a prime source of growth potential for his company. He recognized the advent of economic federation as both permitting, in the first instance, and thereafter necessitating local manufacture of the goods to be sold in that market. First, in terms of potential demand, the size of the unified market was sufficient to justify investment in manufacturing capability large enough to realize all of the economies of scale that have traditionally contributed importantly to plaintiff’s profit performance. Beyond that initial opportunity, Mr. Greenewalt foresaw that as the post-war resuscitation of European industry progressed, competition from that quarter would greatly intensify. Since goods originating within the Common Market area could move throughout that area free of the member-nations’ individual import duties and customs barriers, those goods would enjoy substantial cost advantages over competitive products that had been manufactured outside the area as, for example, in the United States. An additional factor that would eventually make local manufacturing a competitive necessity was predictable customer preference for the reliability of a local, rather than a remote source of supply.\n \n*3 Having concluded that plaintiff could achieve a sustained participation in the expanded European market only by operating there on a fully integrated basis. Mr. Greenewalt determined that the techniques that it had perfected for marketing its products in the United States represented the best means of developing a volume and continuity of European sales sufficient to absorb the output of locally-based manufacturing facilities. He realized that the successful application and adaptation of those techniques to the European market would require a degree to specialized technical capability and promotional skill that the existing network of independent distributors did not have. He therefore proposed that plaintiff establish a permanent presence in Europe to supply those ingredients.\n \nIt is vital for present purposes to recognize that the undertaking that Mr. Greenewalt envisioned was designed to strengthen the distributor selling effort by providing it with essential supporting services, not to dismantle or displace it. His plan specifically contemplated that the independent distributors would continue to perform the entrepreneurial function of purchasing plaintiff’s production for resale to the trade and would therefore retain the associated risks and responsibilities of inventory financing, credit and collection.\n \nAn understanding of the predominant character of plaintiff’s product line and its methods for marketing those products in the United States is basic to an appreciation of the exact nature of the role that Mr. Greenewalt wanted it to assume in the marketing effort for Europe.\n \nThere are only two categories of products in plaintiff’s entire line, each relatively inconsequential in dollar volume, that lend themselves to effective merchandising by ordinary commercial methods. First, there are the few consumer products that it sells; items such as household paints and automotive-care products. Second, are the so-called commodities; products such as sulphuric acid and ammonia that are made to universally standard chemical specifications and are therefore distinguishable from the same products offered by other suppliers only by reference to quoted differences in unit price. Neither of these categories represent the types of products on which plaintiff hoped to build its future in Europe.\n \nThe backbone of plaintiff’s business is the development and manufacture of proprietary products that it sells to other manufacturers for use as basic raw materials in their own operations. Foremost illustrations are the families of man-made fibers and elastomers that are produced by sophisticated chemical formulations and treatment processes that impart to them various physical properties that differ significantly from those of their natural counterparts, viz, animal or vegetable fibers and vegetable-based rubber. When properly adapted to the manufacture of an article whose utility or durability is materially affected by one or more of those properties, the man-made substance will produce a superior result. It is on the basis of that added value that plaintiff has traditionally endeavored to price its proprietary products by reference to a concept that it terms ‘value in use.’ That approach, rather than one emphasizing the attractiveness of its unit prices as contrasted with those of competitive raw materials, has enabled it to command substantial premiums for most of its important products.\n \n*4 For the customer to realize the full value superiority obtainable from plaintiff’s synthesized raw materials at least two things are necessary. First, he must use the particular formulation of, for example, the fiber or elastomer in plaintiff’s product line that is best suited to the performance requirements of the article that he desires to make. Within each family of material, and especially among the fibers, there are a great many types from which to choose, each having somewhat different properties than the others. Second, having selected the proper raw material, the customer must adjust his manufacturing equipment and procedures to the invariably unique processing characteristics of that material.\n \nBecause of the above considerations, the capacity to provide customers with useful and often indispensable technical information and assistance has always been central to plaintiff’s marketing program for its proprietary products. As plaintiff’s principal point of customer contact, its field representatives must be equipped to function as much more than mere sales promoters. They must, in effect, be qualified product engineers with a highly specialized grasp of both product and processing technology. These skills are not ordinarily found in the organization of the typical independent distributor whose attentions are spread over a relatively broad product line and whose primary concern is with maximizing the rate of merchandise turnover.\n \nPlaintiff’s technically qualified field personnel have been instrumental in the execution of another important aspect of its domestic marketing strategy.\n \nDu Pont has gained much business over the years by being willing and able to, in effect, customize its proprietary products to meet the specific needs or preferences of individual customers. An example would be a textile operator who, although favorably disposed towards doing business with plaintiff, is unable to obtain from its standard line of fibers a material that will give him the particular texture or finish that his own clientele demands. In such a situation it is the field representative who alerts the proper production people in plaintiff’s organization to the existence of the potential sales opportunity and provides them with the information that they must have in order to determine whether it is both possible and feasible to so modify their formulations and manufacturing procedures as to produce a fiber with the properties that the prospective account requires. Should these questions be determined in the affirmative, it is up to the field representative to follow through by providing the customer with the processing know-how needed to produce the result that he desires from the raw material that has been tailored to meet his particular requirements.\n \nTo support the efforts of its field personnel, plaintiff has for many years maintained extensive applied research and product-testing facilities at an installation called Chestnut Run, located near its corporate headquarters in Wilmington, Delaware. While the major objective of that operation, which is manned by some 2,000 technical specialists, is the development of new commercial applications for plaintiff’s existing proprietary products, it is also responsible for gathering and disseminating to Du Pont customers new and useful technical information and for helping them overcome any technical problems that they encounter in their use of Du Pont products. The field representatives serve as the communications link in the delivery of those important services, assisting the customer in interpreting and correctly applying the technical data prepared at Chestnut Run and in providing that facility with the information needed to properly identify the specific operating problems on which the customer seeks assistance and then helping him to implement Chestnut Run’s remedial advice.\n \n*5 Technical sales service is plaintiff’s name for the total effort represented by the activities of its technical specialists in the field and the backup provided them by Chestnut Run.\n \nAnother facet of the marketing strategy that plaintiff has employed with great success in the United States is a form of indirect selling that independent distributors are generally unwilling to undertake because it involves the commitment of a considerable amount of time, talent and money that rarely produces an immediate return and sometimes none at all. In simplest terms, the approach is to increase consumption of Du Pont raw materials by stimulating demand for products made from those materials at every point in the chain of distribution between Du Pont and the consumer.\n \nUntil the late 1940s demand for plaintiff’s proprietary products was such that it confined its selling efforts to servicing the requirements of its immediate customers and made no attempt at promotion aimed beyond them. At that time the Textile Fibers Department, the largest of plaintiff’s industrial departments, undertook a market analysis calculated to identify both the various end uses to which its materials were put and the distribution structure through which they passed. The end-use information proved very beneficial to plaintiff by enabling it to conform its product line to the particular performance requirements of the articles for which it hoped to supply the raw material. With a detailed knowledge of the distribution structure plaintiff found that by directing different phases of a coordinated advertising and promotional effort at selected points in the chain it could create a demand at each intermediate level that would radiate back to its immediate customers.\n \nIn sum, the two key features of the program that plaintiff had perfected over the years for marketing its proprietary products in the United States were technical sales service and indirect selling. It was apparent in 1957 that few, if any, of plaintiff’s independent distributors in Europe then had either the inclination or capacity to execute either of those marketing strategies. In that setting, what Mr. Greenewalt proposed as the initial phase of a two-step plan of market development, was simply that plaintiff place in Europe (1) the qualified technical personnel and product-testing facilities necessary to enable the distributors to offer their customers technical sales service and (2) sufficient promotional talent, supported by adequate funding, to mount an indirect selling effort that would produce additional sales opportunities for the distributors by increasing downstream demand for articles made from the raw materials that they could supply.\n \nMr. Greenewalt’s enthusiasm for embarking Du Pont on a program of substantial involvement in the emerging European market was not shared by several of his more conservative and tradition-oriented colleagues on the policy-making Executive Committee. The skeptics continued to favor the company’s long-standing policy that regarded the permanent commitment of Du Pont resources in foreign lands as too risky and generally unrewarding.\n \n*6 In mid-November 1957, when Mr. Greenewalt was in the midst of his concerted effort to persuade a majority of the Executive Committee to his point of view, Du Pont’s treasurer2 directed a memorandum to the committee posing the possibility of neutralizing the risk of European investment by the use of a so-called profit-sanctuary company. The memorandum explained that such a company (domiciled in a country that imposes little or no tax on the income of its domestic corporations derived from sources outside its borders) is principally useful as a means of accumulating funds for foreign investment without the incidence of United States tax. It then states: ‘The total manufacturing and selling profit arising from export sales is estimated to be currently about $30MM per year before Federal taxes on income. The portion of this profit which could be realized by the profit sanctuary trading company, free of U. S. income tax, would depend upon the extent to which export sales can be funnelled through the trading company and upon the price level at which du Pont products were sold to that company.’ The memorandum concluded: ‘Insofar as the du Pont Company is concerned, it currently appears that a significant amount of funds [for foreign investment] could be thus accumulated to advantage only by means of a trading company through which our export sales could be funnelled.’\n \nThe evidence suggests that the treasurer’s memorandum was the outgrowth of a study that his department had begun at least as early as August 1957, examining the question of ‘* * * whether it would be feasible from the standpoint of internal accounting and tax considerations to transfer goods to a tax haven subsidiary at prices less than such transfers would be made to other subsidiaries or Industrial Departments, thus generating funds for investment.’\n \nWhile it appears that Mr. Greenewalt’s proposal to place a marketing management apparatus in Europe was primarily motivated by a desire to further plaintiff’s commercial self-interest, rather than to create a tax sinecure, he definitely and openly favored taking full advantage of all incidental opportunities for tax minimization—particularly if, as the treasurer’s memorandum suggested, untaxed domestic manufacuring profits could be accumulated abroad. The prospect of building the needed European plants with funds that would otherwise go for United States taxes obviously strengthened his hand in persuading the more reluctant members of the Executive Committee to go along with his blueprint for developing European business.\n \nBy March 1958, the Executive Committee had become sufficiently interested in the possibility of organizing a European marketing effort around the concept of a profit-sanctuary company to authorize the formation of an in-house task force to conduct a complete feasibility study and report its findings and recommendations. The group functioned actively for the better part of a year, continuing at least until October 1958, when the Executive Committee officially approved its recommendation that DISA be formed forthwith.\n \n*7 The task force consisted of selected representatives from the International, Legal, and Treasurer’s Departments. Responsibility was apportioned among them along departmental lines. The delegation from the International Department was headed by its general manager, Mr. W. S. Carpenter, III,, that from Legal by Mr. Roy A. Wentz, Jr., and that from Treasurer’s by Mr. Eldon M. Robinson.\n \nIn addition to serving as the task force’s internal coordinator and its liaison with the Executive Committee, the industrial contingent assumed primary responsibility in two major areas; first, gaining industrial department acceptance of the concept of a centralized marketing management effort for Europe and, second, insuring that the organization created to embody that effort not be so constructed that its tax-influenced features would prevent it from providing the supporting marketing services contemplated by Mr. Greenewalt. The more urgent and difficult of these two assignments was that of persuading the general managers of the highly autonomous Du Pont industrial departments to endorse the creation of an authority to which they would be obliged to surrender at least a part of the virtually complete control that they had traditionally exercised over foreign sales of products manufactured by their departments. Cooperation from that quarter was crucial because the marketing agency, as conceived by the task force, would not only be dependent on the industrial departments for the products with which to supply the independent distributors but for ongoing technical and promotional assistance and, of more immediate concern, for the skilled personnel with which to initially staff itself.\n \nThe industrial department general managers viewed the proposed realignment of their export business as more of a commercial hindrance than a help and remained hostile to such a move despite previous attempts at persuasion by no less than Mr. Greenewalt, their corporate superior and the chief proponent of change. Finally, and primarily as a concession to the significant tax benefits that Mr. Carpenter assured would result from the creation of a centralized marketing agency for overseas sales, the general managers of the two industrial departments (Elastomer Chemicals and Textile Fibers), whose products accounted for the bulk of European sales, agreed to participate in the planned undertaking. Their willingness to do so was also induced by an unprecedented arrangement that ran counter to plaintiff’s established policy of treating each of its operating units as a separate profit center. Contrary to that policy, it was agreed that the financial results of the marketing agency’s operations would be appropriately consolidated into those of each of the industrial departments that dealt with it. Consequently, for all internal corporate purposes, such as return-on-investment criteria and determination of bonus compensation for executives, the participating industrial departments were evaluated by plaintiff’s top management as though the marketing agency had no separate existence. The general managers, who were otherwise directly concerned with the prices at which products manufactured by their departments were sold, accordingly became totally disinterested in the prices at which the products for which they were responsible would be transferred to DISA.\n \n*8 Once the International Department’s representatives secured the acquiescence of the industrial departments principally involved they devoted their attention to projecting the staff and related logistical requirements of the proposed organization and to maintaining liaison with the Executive Committee.\n \nIn keeping with general company policy, the Treasurer’s group, headed by Mr. Robinson, bore primary responsibility for all tax and financial aspects of the undertaking, with the Legal Department’s representatives serving as its counsel in those areas. In addition, the Legal group was responsible for compliance with those non-tax provisions of foreign law affecting the organization and operation of the entity to be formed.\n \nIt is clear from the evidence that Messrs. Wentz and Robinson approached their task force duties with tax minimization upper most in mind. That was the objective to which all of their efforts were directed and the consideration that controlled all of their recommendations. Moreover, except for an extravagant proposal by Mr. Wentz concerning pricing, all of such recommendations were incorporated in the structure and operation of the organization ultimately formed as DISA.\n \nEven before the formation of a task force study group was authorized by the Executive Committee, Mr. Wentz retained the consulting services of a Chicago attorney who was a reputed expert on the formation of overseas tax-haven subsidiaries by United States corporations. Though the attorney did not testify in this proceeding, two items of evidence reveal his expansiv approach to the utilization of the profit-sanctuary concept as a means of reducing liability for United States tax.\n \nFirst, in August 1957, a member of the Treasurer’s Department called attention to an article by the attorney in which he urged that the universally accepted ‘arm’s-length’ test for determining the acceptability of prices at which a domestic parent transfers goods to its foreign subsidiary (that standard being what the parent would charge an unrelated party for the same goods) was too restrictive and that a more proper criterion is simply whether such prices are ‘fair.’\n \nSecond, after the attorney was retained, Messrs. Wentz and Robinson went to Chicago to confer with him. During the visit he illustrated his philosophy by disclosing to them the essential elements of a tax-haven subsidiary arrangement that he had designed for a Chicago-based company doing business overseas. The effect of the arrangement, which the attorney represented had been accepted by the Internal Revenue Service, was to allocate to the foreign subsidiary the bulk of the total profit on the goods involved. Noting that the only event that occurred overseas with respect to those goods was the passage of title, Mr. Robinson concluded that arrangement created merely a ‘paper’ type of operation that plaintiff would not be interested in emulating.\n \nPursuant to his retainer, the Chicago attorney issued plaintiff an advisory opinion in May 1958, strongly recommending that it employ a tax-haven subsidiary domiciled in Switzerland as the vehicle through which to conduct the market management activities that it planned for Europe. Despite the purely service-oriented nature of those activities (it being understood throughout that the independent distributors would continue to perform the entire direct selling function), the opinion presupposed that the products to be supported by them would be sold to the subsidiary rather than directly to the distributors, as in the past. Although service organizations are typically compenstated on a fee basis, it does not appear that such an approach was ever considered in this instance. A plausible explanation would seem to be found in the treasurer’s observation in his memorandum of mid-November 1957, to the Executive Committee to the effect that: ‘The portion of this profit [i. e., both manufacturing and selling] which could be realized by the profit-sanctuary trading company, free of U. S. income tax, would depend upon the extent to which export sales can be funnelled through the trading company and upon the price level at which du Pont products were sold to that company.’ (Emphasis added.) Parenthetically, it is worth noting that in practice DISA received its full markup on significant volumes of product that were ‘funneled’ through it in situations where the marketing services for which it was formed were either inappropriate or inaccessible.\n \n*9 As earlier explained, sales of commodity-type products are influenced almost solely by direct price competition. Because of their intrinsic nature, there is simply no role for such sophisticated marketing techniques as technical sales service or indirect selling. Nonetheless, during the years in suit some $6.5 million worth of commodities were routed through DISA, from which it received a profit of approximately $960,000.\n \nPrior to the years in suit, plaintiff periodically made so-called opportunistic sales of its textile fibers to European competitors who, for various reasons, were temporarily unable to produce sufficient quantities of material to satisfy their customers’ needs. Obviously, plaintiff would not be interested in strengthening the position of its competitors by supporting the products that they sold to them with DISA’s marketing services. Despite the contrary dictates of logic, during the years in suit $13,899,200 worth of textile fibers destined for competitive co-producers passed through DISA yielding it a gross profit of almost $3 million.\n \nFinally, in 1959 and 1960 significant volumes of product bound for independent distributors in Australia and South Africa were funneled through DISA even though, as the evidence shows, it was not in a position to render, and did not render, any marketing services beyond those ordinarily supplied by the export sections of the industrial departments that produced the goods.\n \nReturning to the matter of task force effort leading to the formation of DISA, in July 1958 Messrs. Wentz and Robinson traveled to Switzerland, Belgium and Holland. Theye were accompanied by another member of the Legal Department and by an executive from plaintiff’s London office. The principal objectives of the trip were (1) to secure an advance understanding with the Swiss authorities on the effective rate of tax to which profits realized by a Swiss marketing subsidiary from sales made outside Switzerland would be subject, (2) to explore basically the same question with the Belgian tax authorities, and (3) to determine, as between Belgium and Holland, which of those countries would grant the more favorable tax treatment to profits earned on export sales of Orlon to be manufactured in a plant that plaintiff was planning to locate in one or the other of them. Mr. Robinson also consulted with banking interests concerning the respective currency exchange aspects of the operations that were contemplated.\n \nThe representatives found Switzerland’s tax climate, at both the corporate and individual levels, to be considerably more favorable than Belgium’s. They were able to negotiate a regime with the Swiss that would result in an effective rate (federal and cantonal) for the proposed selling subsidiary of less than 9 percent if it were located in Geneva. The individual tax rates imposed by the Swiss on the United States nationals (i. e., Du Pont transferees) who would be required, initially at least, to staff the marketing operation were equally as attractive on a comparative basis. In response to a request by the International Department for an opinion on the matter of optimum location for the proposed marketing entity, plaintiff’s London office summarized its sentiments as follows: ‘While it is a fact that Brussels [headquarters for the Common Market] is more centrally located than Geneva, geographically and in relation to the population of European markets of interest to us, we do not consider that there is a significant disadvantage here in relation to the very real advantage of Switzerland as to corporate and personal taxes that dominate in favor of Geneva.’\n \n*10 Concerning location of the proposed Orlon manufacturing plant, the task force found that from a tax standpoint Holland was preferable to Belgium in that they were encouraged to believe that the Dutch would be willing to agree in advance to tax only 20 percent of the total profit realized from Orlon produced in that country and sold abroad by a Swiss marketing agency. Such an agreement was later negotiated and plaintiff located its Orlon plant at Dordrecht, Holland, rather than in Belgium, as originally planned.\n \nIn a joint memorandum of October 3, 1958, the International and Treasurer’s Departments reported the findings and recommendations of the task force to the Executive Committee, the ultimate recommendation being that a profit-sanctuary corporation be formed in Switzerland to handle export sales in Europe of domestically-produced elastomer and textile fiber products. In that connection, the memorandum suggested the probability that as much as three-quarters of the total profit on domestically-produced goods sold for export could be allocated to the profit-sanctuary corporation.\n \nIt appears from the evidence that every significant recommendation that emerged from the task force, and was endorsed by the International and Treasurer’s Departments, was substantially, if not totally, shaped by tax rather than commercial considerations.\n \nOn October 22, 1958, the Executive Committee registered its lack of objection ‘in principle’ to the formation of a European marketing subsidiary but withhold specific approval, presumably pending the final outcome of ongoing tax negotiations with the Dutch with reference to the proposed Orlon plant. By a memorandum of November 21, 1958, the International Department advised the Executive Committee that those negotiations had culminated successfully from Du Pont’s point of view. On November 26, 1958, the committee reacted to this news by formally approving the formation of a Swiss subsidiary to be known as DISA.\n \nIt will be recalled that in his memorandum of November 1957, to the Executive Committee, the treasurer explained that the amount of profit from goods sold for export that could be realized by the profit-sanctuary trading company, free of United States income tax, would depend upon two factors; the volume of sales that could be funneled through the trading company and the price level at which Du Pont transferred its domestically-produced goods to that company. As already explained, volume was maximized by routing through the trading company a great deal of product as to which, for various reasons, the marketing services that it was created to perform bore no relationship. The other critical element of the equation, the intercompany transfer price, was left solely to the ingenuity and judgment of Mr. Eldon Robinson.\n \nMr. Robinson candidly acknowledged that he approached the pricing problem with the objective of using DISA as a capital generating vehicle. To that end, he made no pretext of attempting to relate the differential between what DISA paid plaintiff and what it would receive from the independent distributors to the commercial or economic value of the marketing services that it was to perform. Rather, his sole consideration was in developing the lowest possible transfer price that he felt would be tolerated by the United States taxing authorities. Thus, he conceded that he would have set the transfer prices so low as to shift 99 percent of the total profits to DISA if he had felt that such prices would have been acceptable to ‘the tax agents.’ Indeed, the evidence shows that within plaintiff’s organization, including Mr. Robinson, the pricing structure ultimately employed was recognized as unreasonably low.\n \n*11 As already noted, the memoranda from the International and Treasurer’s Departments that formed the basis on which the Executive Committee approved the formation of DISA referred generally to the expectation that it would be possible to utilize a transfer price that would lodge as much as 75 percent of total profit with DISA. In one draft version of the final memorandum Mr. Robinson referred to such a price as ‘artificially’ low. Earlier, a somewhat higher transfer price was characterized as ‘fictitious’ by the managing director of Du Pont (UK) from whence DISA was to receive much of the neoprene destined for European distributors.\n \nIt was not until January 1958, that Mr. Robinson addressed himself to the final refinement of the pricing policy and the development of the mechanics necessary to implement it.\n \nBy way of background, the evidence shows that one of the issues covered in a Revenue Service audit of plaintiff’s return for an earlier tax year (1951) concerned the computation of the foreign tax credit to which it was entitled in respect to income earned from export sales that involved intercompany transfers of goods. In that context, Mr. Robinson had studied the provisions of section 863 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, dealing with the allocation of income, expenses, losses and deductions to sources within and without the United States. He recalled from that experience that one of the Commissioner’s regulations interpreting the statute provided as follows:\n \n\n\n§ 1.863.3. Income from the sale of personal property derived partly from within and partly from without the United States.\n* * *\n(b) Income partly from sources within a foreign country—(1) General. This paragraph relates to gains, profits, and income derived from the sale of personal property produced (in whole or in part) by the taxpayer within the United States and sold within a foreign country, or produced (in whole or in part) by the taxpayer within a foreign country and sold within the United States. Pursuant to section 863(b) such items shall be treated as derived partly from sources within the United States and partly from sources within a foreign country.\n \n(2) Allocation or apportionment. The taxable income from sources within the United States, in the case of the items to which this paragraph applies, shall be determined according to the examples set forth in this subparagraph. For such purposes, the deductions for the personal exemptions shall not be taken into account, but the special deductions described in paragraph (c) of § 1.861–8 shall be taken into account.\n \nExample (1). Where the manufacturer or producer regularly sells part of his output to wholly independent distributors or other selling concerns in such a way as to establish fairly an independent factory or production price—or shows to the satisfaction of the district director (or, if applicable, the Director of International Operations) that such an independent factory or production price has been otherwise established—unaffected by considerations of tax liability, and the selling or distributing branch or department of the business is located in a different country from that in which the factory is located or the production carried on, the taxable income attributable to sources within the United States shall be computed by an accounting which treats the products as sold by the factory or productive department of the business to the distributing or selling department at the independent factory price so established. In all such cases the basis of the accounting shall be fully explained in a statement attached to the return for the taxable year.\n \n*12 Example (2). (i) Where an independent factory or production price has not been established as provided under example (1), the taxable income shall first be computed by deducting from the gross income derived from the sale of personal property produced (in whole or in part) by the taxpayer within the United States and sold within a foreign country or produced (in whole or in part) by the taxpayer within a foreign country and sold within the United States, the expenses, losses, or other deductions properly allocated and apportioned thereto in accordance with the rules set forth in § 1.861–8.\n \n(ii) Of the amount of taxable income so determined, one-half shall be apportioned in accordance with the value of the taxpayer’s property within the United States and within the foreign country, the portion attributable to sources within the United States being determined by multiplying such one-half by a fraction the numerator of which consists of the value of the taxpayer’s property within the United States, and the denominator of which consists of the value of the taxpayer’s property both within the United States and within the foreign country. The remaining one-half of such taxable income shall be apportioned in accordance with the gross sales of the taxpayer within the United States and within the foreign country, the portion attributable to sources within the United States being determined by multiplying such one-half by a fraction the numerator of which consists of the taxpayer’s gross sales for the taxable year or period within the United States, and the denominator of which consists of the taxpayer’s gross sales for the taxable year or period both within the United States and within the foreign country.\n \n \nIn searching for a means to justify attributing three-quarters of total profit to DISA, Mr. Robinson found that if he applied the 50–50 allocation illustrated in example (2) of the above regulation by recognizing only marginal, rather than full costs, the net effect would be to place approximately 75 percent of actual profit with DISA; this because plaintiff’s indirect costs, which would be ignored for purposes of the computation, far exceeded those of DISA.\n \nIn his testimony, Mr. Robinson identified example (2), quoted above, as the sole and entire basis for the pricing structure that he established for sales to DISA. In so doing, he acknowledged that section 863 does not purport to apply to intercompany transfers such as were involved with DISA and further, that plaintiff’s records did not contain the information necessary to apply the example on a marginal cost basis because it had never accounted for its activities on other than a full cost basis, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. He stated that notwithstanding the complication caused by contrary record-keeping practices he preferred to express the profit allocation in terms of marginal costs because he felt that the Internal Revenue Service would be more apt to accept a pricing system that appeared to allocate only one-half of total profit to DISA.\n \n*13 Viewed in the light of his obvious competence and broad experience, there are at least two factors indicating that Mr. Robinson’s reliance on example (2), above, was superficial rather than merit-premised.\n \nFirst, he surely was aware that from the standpoint of both general policy, well-known in the Treasurer’s Department, and consistent operating procedure, plaintiff did not treat its export sales as a marginal outlet. Such sales were traditionally expected to produce and did, in fact, produce profits equal to or greater than those obtained on domestic business. Consequently, apart from the practical problem of the nonexistence of marginal cost accounting records, there was simply no reason to regard sales to DISA as representing marginal business.\n \nSecond, there is nothing in the language of either section 863 or the regulation interpreting it suggesting that the costs to be allocated are marginal or, indeed, anything less than actual.\n \nOn June 15, 1959, after DISA was incorporated but before it became operational, Mr. Robinson issued a directive to the industrial departments specifying the manner in which goods were to be priced to DISA. The instruction was that where the total cost to make and sell an item was less than DISA’s selling price to unrelated parties the item was to be priced to DISA at total manufacturing cost plus 25 percent of the overall profit realized from both its manufacture and sale to an independent purchaser. The further instruction was that where the total cost to make and sell was greater than DISA’s projected selling price the product involved was to be transferred to DISA at that price less all of DISA’s anticipated costs. The essence of the directive was therefore that where the sale to the independent purchaser was at a price level that yielded an overall profit DISA was to receive 75 percent of that profit, but where the ultimate sale produced an overall loss DISA was nonetheless to recover all of its costs so that the entire loss would be borne by the plaintiff.\n \nThat the above pricing formula bore no relationship to considerations of economic or commercial quid pro quo forthcoming from DISA is forcefully attested by the fact that the same articles were transferred to DISA at different prices, depending upon their point of origin. Thus, whereas domestically-produced neoprene and orlon were priced to DISA in accordance with the formula outlined above, neoprene produced by Du Pont (UK) was transferred at a price reflecting only 50 percent of total profit to DISA, while orlon produced by plaintiff’s wholly-owned subsidiary in Holland was transferred at a price that resulted in DISA’s reaping 80 percent of total profit. According to Mr. Robinson, these differentials were predicated solely on plaintiff’s assessment of what the taxing authorities in the jurisdictions of origin would tolerate.\n \nFinally, on the matter of pricing policy it is worth noting, in the interest of general perspective, that both Mr. Wentz and the Chicago attorney who [whom] plaintiff retained as a profit-sanctuary consultant regarded Mr. Robinson’s formula for allocating 75 percent of total profit to DISA as far too conservative. Although Mr. Wentz was not called to testify, the evidence shows that he advocated a pricing structure that would have placed 90 percent of overall profit with DISA, albeit he never spelled out a supporting rationale. The Chicago attorney advanced no specific percentage, advising only that it be greater than that afforded by Mr. Robinson’s formula.\n \n*14 In 1959, during which it was operational only for the last 4 months of the year, DISA received 48.3 percent of the total profit (determined on a full cost basis) realized on the sale of goods that were manufactured and transferred to it by the plaintiff. For 1960 the corresponding figure was 57.1 percent.\n \nMr. Robinson explained that DISA’s failure to realize three-quarters of the entire profit, as contemplated by the explicit terms of the pricing formula that he promulgated, was due primarily to the inclusion of certain items in manufacturing costs that were not costs at all but increments of departmental profit. Those profits were generated by interdepartmental transfers of work-in-process that occurred in instances where manufacture of the product transferred to DISA required one or more ingredients that the transferor department acquired from another department within plaintiff’s corporate structure. In such situations, in keeping with plaintiff’s established policy of recognizing each industrial department as a distinct profit center, the ingredients involved were transferred to the acquiring department, not at the transferor department’s cost but at that figure plus a profit increment that typically represented the difference between actual cost and fair market value.\n \nAs a senior member of the Treasurer’s Department, Mr. Robinson was undoubtedly aware of plaintiff’s long-established policy governing the pricing of interdepartmental transfers when he formulated the pricing structure applicable to DISA. There is nothing to suggest, however, in the extensive body of pertinent documentary evidence charting the evolution of the DISA pricing formula that the potential impact of antecedent interdepartmental transfers was considered at all. In short, the evidence shows that the objective was to allocate three-quarters of total profit to DISA, not that amount reduced by incremental manufacturing profits attributable to interdepartmental transfers.\n \nEqually unanticipated by Mr. Robinson’s pricing directive was the fact that during the years in suit DISA incurred losses on its handling of a few items supplied it by plaintiff. None of them represented as much as 1 percent of DISA’s total sales for the periods in which the losses occurred. The evidence suggests that the losses were attributable to the excessive burden of allocated expenses on the very small volume of merchandise involved. In all other respects the Robinson pricing formula effectively insulated DISA from operating loss. Moreover, it served admirably to accomplish the fundamental objective of providing funds for overseas plant construction, as evidenced by the fact that over a 7-year period, beginning in December 1962, DISA made loans totaling $76,166,218 to plaintiff’s European subsidiaries and affiliates. The evidence does not show the extent to which that impressive total represents revolving funds.\n \nDISA neither declared nor paid any dividends until 1964. In that year and thereafter it paid dividends as follows:\n \n\n\n\n\nYear\n \n|Amount\n \n|\n1964\t\n \n|$ 8,000,000\n \n|\n1965\t\n \n|18,950,000\n \n|\n1966\t\n \n|826,000\n \n|\n1967\t\n \n|5,800,000\n \n|\n1968\t\n \n|none\n \n|\n1969\t\n \n|100,000\n \n|\n1970\t\n \n|4,736,000\n \n|\n1971\t\n \n|6,294,000\n \n|\n1972 (to Nov. 30)\t\n \n|6,068,000\n \n|\nTotal\t\n \n|$50,774,000\n \n|\n\n\n\n\n*15 Mr. Milton Campbell, director of the European division of plaintiff’s International Department and board chairman of DISA, testified that DISA’s dividend policy was determined by plaintiff’s Treasurer’s Department. He also acknowledged his own understanding that enactment of the Revenue Act of 1962 was a factor prompting dividend distribution. In fact, the above-listed dividends constituted the minimum distributions specified for a ‘controlled foreign corporation’ such as DISA by the provisions of the Revenue Act of 1962. Section 963, Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as amended.\n \nDespite the fact that during the period in suit DISA’s presence and participation in the marketing of plaintiff’s products in the geographic area that it served increased neither the volume of product sold nor the price level at which the sales were made, the evidence suggests that within the limitations of its manpower and facilities DISA performed certain commercially beneficial functions, particularly in the area of textile fibers, without which plaintiff’s share of the European market might very well have diminished. This is not to say, however, that the value of those benefits to the plaintiff was at all commensurate with the amount that it paid DISA for providing them.\n \nAs related in considerable detail in the accompanying findings of fact, DISA supported the European marketing effort in a service capacity, not as a risk-bearing entre-preneurial participant.\n \nNot the least valuable of DISA’s contributions was its upgrading of the general quality of the independent distributors that represented plaintiff in Europe. It put a stop to the thievery that had been practiced by some of the distributors who falsely inflated their landed costs of merchandise in order to obtain from the plaintiff profit margins greater than it thought that it was allowing.\n \nThe mere fact of DISA’s permanent presence on the scene served to inhibit some of the distributors’ tendency to sacrifice volume opportunities in order to sell plaintiff’s products at prices higher than those suggested by it.\n \nDISA evaluated the performance of each of the distributors and terminated those that were not willing and able to put forth the type of effort necessary to provide their customers with adequate technical sales service and replaced them with distributors who were.\n \nMost of DISA’s activities in the area of indirect selling were directed to textile fibers. In some instances those efforts proved fruitful.\n \nDISA’s role in the realm of advertising appears to have been mostly, if not entirely, concerned with the functions of coordination and media placement rather than with the origination of copy.\n \nAs a result of the pricing structure imposed by the plaintiff, DISA’s gross margin for each of the years in suit averaged 26 percent of the price at which it resold the goods that were transferred to it, while its total operating expenses for 1959 and 1960 amounted to only 9.15 percent and 6.45 percent, respectively, of resale price.\n \n*16 Aside from a preliminary attack on the deficiencies founded on the claim that the agent’s methodology in computing them was defective as both inconsistent in approach as between the 2 years involved and not authorized by the regulations as to either year,3 plaintiff’s two-fold position in this litigation is that a reallocation of income is unwarranted because the prices at which it transferred goods to DISA meet the test of arm’s-length equivalence both as contemplated by section 482 and as specifically defined by the treasury regulations issued thereunder.\n \nPlaintiff is driven to the first of its contentions by the fact that the arrangement that it seeks to defend was so designed as to insulate DISA from most, if not all, of the entrepreneurial risks and responsibilities to which an unrelated party performing DISA’s function would normally be exposed.\n \nPlaintiff rationalizes its imaginative but inherently untenable interpretation of section 482 as follows (Pltf. Br. p. 38):\nA case can arise under Section 482 only when there are transactions entered into under controlled rather than arm’s length conditions. The law requires that a taxpayer’s income from such transactions be equivalent to what it would have earned had it in fact been involved in an arm’s length transaction. This arm’s length standard necessarily substitutes a hypothetical inquiry into what might have been between independent parties for what actually took place between related corporations. Because the law is that tax results should be independent of any corporate relationship between the parties to a business transaction, the arm’s length standard cannot be applied meaningfully if any consideration is given to aspects of the controlled relationship. Only those attributes of the plaintiff-DISA relationship that do not inhere in or result from plaintiff’s status as DISA’s sole shareholder may be considered in selecting an appropriate comparable under the arm’s length standard, or in making adjustments allowed by the Regulation, for they are the only attributes that an independent party, contracting at arm’s length to assume DISA’s responsibilities would inherently have [Emphasis added.]\n \n \nIn the operating environment that plaintiff fashioned for DISA, the latter was not only virtually guaranteed a substantial profit on all of its major product purchases and specifically assured of recovering its expenses on those that yielded no profit; it was permitted to equip itself to perform its assigned functions by selecting from plaintiff’s reservoir of skilled personnel; it was not exposed to meaningful credit risk and its working capital needs were lightened by the extension to it of trade credit terms more liberal than those that it was obliged to extend to its customers.\n \n*17 As plaintiff would have it, comparability for purposes of section 482 contemplates an unrelated party performing all of DISA’s functions under conditions that include none of the above protections and benefits because plaintiff’s financial self-interest would rule out its extending similar benevolence to an unrelated party. Thus, under plaintiff’s approach the first step in subjecting the compensation received by a controlled entity to the test of an arm’s-length comparison is to reconstitute the entity into the likeness of the uncontrolled stranger. In effect, you would then be comparing the stranger with itself.\n \nAccording to plaintiff’s paradoxical reasoning, the farther removed from arm’s-length normality the terms of a transaction between a parent and its subsidiary the more impervious that transaction is to restructuring under section 482. Carried to its logical extreme, this would mean that if all of the income received by a subsidiary were attributable to the indulgence of its parent, as opposed to considerations of commercial quid pro quo, such income would be immunized from reallocation to the parent in the absence of a finding of overall sham.\n \nIt is, of course, the very departures from arm’s-length dealing represented by the factors previously enumerated that justify the Commissioner’s resort to the corrective potential of section 482 in the present situation. Those same departures cannot serve to limit the capacity of that provision to produce correction.\n \nIn sum, to the extent that the risk-bearing aspects of the contrived climate in which DISA performed its functions can be identified as influencing the price that an independent party could command for performing the same functions, those considerations may not be ignored in arriving at the arm’s-length bench-mark to which DISA’s prices are to be compared.\n \nNot surprisingly, in view of the altogether noncommercial origin of the pricing structure under which DISA operated, plaintiff has been unable to produce a single ‘real world’ or hypothetical illustration of the fact that the amount of conpensation that DISA received was not excessive when measured by free-market standards. Each of its unsuccessful attempts to do so is detailed in the accompanying findings of fact. Findings 102–111, infra. The characteristic that distinguishes virtually all of them from DISA is the element of entrepreneurial risk.\n \nThe overriding importance of the risk factor in the valuation equation is nowhere illustrated better or more forcefully than by the testimony of plaintiff’s principal expert witness, Dr. Robert B. Stobaugh, Jr. He concluded that an independent party performing DISA’s functions would be entitled to no less than 50 percent of the total profit derived from the manufacture and sale of the products that it handled. His explanation of the basis for that opinion disclosed, however, that most of that allowance was justified as compensation for assumption of the risks of loss resulting from operations and possible termination of the arrangement by the manufacturer. DISA, of course, was subject to neither of those risks. As contrasted with the 50 percent figure based on his assumed conception of DISA, Dr. Stobaugh opined that an independent party performing all of DISA’s marketing functions but doing so without exposure to the risks of either operating loss or loss associated with an involuntary termination of its services would be entitled to not more than 10 percent of the total profit.\n \n*18 Dr. Stanley Miller, the second expert called by the plaintiff, also expressed the view that a marketing management organization, which he perceived DISA to be, was entitled to approximately 50 percent of the total profit realized from the manufacture and subsequent distribution of the product with which it was involved. He then explained, however, that in his vocabulary marketing management organization cannot be defined solely in terms of its service functions, adding that an indispensable attribute of such an organization is proprietorship entailing exposure to entrepreneurial risk. He defined that attribute as involving ‘* * * a risk-taking function responsible for everything from manufacturing costs to finished price.’\n \nDr. Miller identified one arrangement that he deemed comparable to the Du Pont-DISA relationship. It was a joint venture formed in 1956 by a United States Company, Haloid (now Xerox) and J. Arthur Rank of England, a well-established manufacturer and distributor of film in world markets, for the production and marketing of the Xerox copier outside of the United States and Canada. A new company, Rank-Xerox, was formed in which the two participants had equal equity interests. As consideration for its stock Haloid contributed all of its copier technology, including patents. Rank contributed $3 million for its one-half stock interest, the funds to provide financing for the new company which was to both manufacture nad market Xerox copiers. Until volume reached an agreed level the parties were to share profits and losses equally. Thereafter, Xerox was to receive two-thirds of the profits and Rank the remaining one-third. Dr. Miller analogized the role of Xerox to that of plaintiff and Rank, which he conceived as a marketing manager with the appropriate attributes of entrepreneurship, to DISA.\n \nIn fact, DISA bore none of the incidents of risk that Dr. Miller identified as indigenous to the type of a marketing management organization that in his judgment would be entitled to share equally in the total profits of a manufacturing-marketing venture.\n \nMr. Marvin Bower, a senior executive with the management consulting firm of McKinsey & Company, appeared as plaintiff’s third expert witness. He ventured the opinion that an organization engaged in the marketing functions that he understood DISA was performing for the plaintiff would be entitled to receive as compensation one-half of the total profit derived from the manufacture and sale of the products involved. He acknowledged, however, that in reaching that conclusion he did not take into account the relative apportionment of entrepreneurial risk as between plaintiff and DISA. He then volunteered that if he were to assume (1) that the manufacturer agreed to insulate the marketer from the risk of operating loss and (2) that the marketer was succeeding to an existing market for the manufacturer’s products, then the marketer’s share of total profits should be reduced from 50 percent to, at most, 20 percent. Both of these assumptions were actualities in the Du Pont-DISA relationship.\n \n*19 In sum, plaintiff’s experts unanimously agreed on the general proposition that risk considerations weigh heavily on the amount of compensation to which a marketing organization is entitled for its efforts. They further agreed that such an organization, if risk-oriented specifically in the manner of DISA, would not be entitled to a share of the profits even approaching that plaintiff bestowed on DISA.\n \nPlaintiff also offered evidence depicting several ‘real world’ commercial relationships that it contends support the reasonableness of the compensation allotted DISA in return for what it did. Actually, as shown in the findings of fact covering each of them, none of these arrangements are analogous in relevant particulars to the Du Pont-DISA relationship and, again, the most prominent and significant distinguishing feature is DISA’s singular risk position. Findings 105–111, infra.\n \nPlaintiff’s companion argument, the one that it has principally stressed throughout, does not depend on an evidentiary showing that its prices to DISA are generally in line with those charged in comparable transactions between unrelated parties. The point, instead, is that whatever the indicia of an arm’s-length price in the context of the general language of section 482, the Commissioner has preempted the issue in transactions involving the sale of tangible property by promulgating regulations embodying a very specific formula (called the resale price method) for constructively determining an arm’s-length price and making its application obligatory in the circumstances of this case. Plaintiff says that under that formula, which appears in Treas. Reg. § 1.482–2(e), its prices to DISA must be deemed arm’s length as a matter of law because DISA’s resulting markup (gross margin) was, by defendant’s own admission, within the limit imposed by the formula. As will be apparent, plaintiff’s interpretation of the regulation is entirely correct as far as it goes. The argument must nonetheless fail because, without explanation, plaintiff simply ignores a qualifying element of the formula, contained in one of the subsections of the section of the regulations delineating the resale price method. This, of course, may not be done. Treasury regulations, like statutes, must be be considered as a whole and their parts not treated as independent enactments. Keinath v. Commissioner [73–1 USTC ¶12,928], 480 F. 2d 57, 65 (8th Cir. 1973); Larkin et al. v. United States [35–2 USTC ¶ 9549], 78 F. 2d 951, 954 (8th Cir. 1935).\n \nThe voluminous and often prolix regulations issued under section 482 begin with a succinct and common-sense exposition of their scope and purpose. Thus, Treas. Reg. § 1.482–1(b)(1) simply advises that: ‘The purpose of section 482 is to place a controlled taxpayer on a tax parity with an uncontrolled taxpayer’ and explains that to reach that parity: ‘The standard to be applied in every case is that of an uncontrolled taxpayer dealing at arm’s length with another uncontrolled taxpayer.’\n \n*20 An arm’s-length price is simply a different label for the fair market value of the goods or services to which the price relates.\n \nThe courts have long recognized that the ascertainment of value entails a factual inquiry and is therefore not amenable to determination by the application of fixed rules or mechanical formulae. The Minnesota Rate Cases, 230 U. S. 352, 434 (1913); Standard Oil Co. of New Jersey v. Southern Pacific Co., 268 U. S. 146, 156 (1925); Central Trust Co. v. United States [62–2 USTC ¶ 12,092], 158 Ct. Cl. 504, 535, 305 F. 2d 393, 411 (1962); Southern Natural Gas Co. v. United States, 188 Ct. Cl. 302, 358, [69–2 USTC ¶ 9473] 412 F. 2d 1222, 1256 (1969); Righter v. United States, 194 Ct. Cl. 400, 425 [71–1 USTC ¶ 12,758], 439 F. 2d 1204, 1218 (1971).\n \nDespite his own prior recognition of the same principle, Rev. Rul. 54–77 (1954–1 CUM. BULL. 187, 188) the Commissioner has nonetheless unaccountably departed from it by undertaking to define the fair market value of goods or services for purposes of section 482 by reference to an elaborate array of largely mechanical formulae. By doing so, in the case of controlled transactions involving the sale of tangible property, the Commissioner sowed the seed for plaintiff’s major argument in this suit.\n \nTreas. Reg. § 1.482–1(d)(1) expressly remands a taxpayer to the provisions of § 1.482–2 ‘for specific rules relating to methods of allocation in the case of several types of business transactions.’\n \nReferring to transactions involving the sale of tangible property, as here involved, Treas. Reg. § 1.482–2(e)(1)(ii) provides, in pertinent part:\nSubparagraphs (2), (3), and (4) of this paragraph describe three methods of determining an arm’s length price and the standards for applying each method. They are, respectively, the comparable uncontrolled price method, the resale price method, and the cost plus method. If there are comparable uncontrolled sales as defined in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph, the comparable uncontrolled price method must be utilized because it is the method likely to result in the most accurate estimate of an arm’s length price (for the reason that it is based upon the price actually paid by unrelated parties for the same or similar products). If there are no comparable uncontrolled sales, then the resale price method must be utilized if the standards for its application are met because it is the method likely to result in the next most accurate estimate in such instances (for the reason that, in such instances, the arm’s length price determined under such method is based more directly upon actual arm’s length transactions than is the cost plus method). A typical situation where the resale price method may be required is where a manufacturer sells products to a related distributor which, without further processing, resells the products in uncontrolled transactions. [Emphasis added.]\n \n \nOn brief, defendant states: ‘We do not take issue with taxpayer’s contention that, in effect, DISA has no free market counterpart.’ Deft. Br. p. 68. Consequently, the comparable uncontrolled price method, as comprehended by Treas. Reg. § 1.482–2(e)(2)(i), cannot be applied on the facts of this case. Resort must, therefore, be made to the resale price method defined by Treas. Reg. § 1.482–2(e)(3). The section begins with the following summary:\n*21 Resale price method. (i) Under the pricing method described as the ‘resale price method’, the arm’s length price of a controlled sale is equal to the applicable resale price (as defined in subdivision (iv) or (v) of this subparagraph), reduced by an appropriate markup, and adjusted as provided in subdivision (ix) of this subparagraph. An appropriate markup is computed by multiplying the applicable resale price by the appropriate markup percentage as defined in subdivision (vi) of this subparagraph. Thus, where one member of a group of controlled entities sells property to another member which resells the property in uncontrolled sales, if the applicable resale price of the property involved in the controlled sale is $100 and the appropriate markup percentage for resales by the buyer is 20 percent, the arm’s length price of the controlled sale is $80 ($100 minus 20 percent x $100), adjusted as provided in subdivision (ix) of this subparagraph. [Emphasis added.]\n \n \nThe ‘applicable resale price’ referred to above is thereafter defined in subdivision (iv) as follows:\nFor the purposes of this subparagraph the ‘applicable resale price’ is the price at which it is anticipated that property purchased in the controlled sale will be resold by the buyer in an uncontrolled sale. The ‘applicable resale price’ will generally be equal to either the price at which current resales of the same property are being made or the resale price of the particular item of property involved. [Emphasis added.]\n \n \nSince the distributors to whom DISA typically sold the products that it received from the plaintiff were unrelated parties, DISA’s selling price to them represents the ‘applicable resale price’ contemplated by the regulation.\n \nIn turn, subdivision (vi) defines the ‘appropriate markup’ by which the ‘applicable resale price’ must be reduced, as follows:\nFor the purposes of this subparagraph, the appropriate markup percentage is equal to the percentage of gross profit (expressed as a percentage of sales) earned by the buyer (reseller) or another party on the resale of property which is both purchased and resold in an incontrolled transaction, which resale is most similar to the applicable resale of the property involved in the controlled sale. * * *. [Emphasis added.]\n \n \nAs earlier noted (page 35, supra), DISA’s gross profit (expressed as a percentage of sales) averaged 26 percent on its controlled transactions with the plaintiff during the years in suit. The undisputed evidence, most of it defendant’s, shows that percentage to compare favorably with the percentage of gross profit normally realized by independent operators buying merchandise for resale, for example, large-scale wholesale distributors. Given that degree of margin comparability with uncontrolled transactions, plaintiff says that by definition the regulation constitutes its prices to DISA as arm’s-length. If the regulatory formulation of the resale price method provided for no further adjustment plaintiff’s conclusion would be sound. Such is not the case, however, as noted at the outset.\n \n*22 Treas. Reg. § 1.482–2(e)(3)(i), supra, distinctly identifies the four steps entailed in arriving at an arm’s-length price determined by the resale price method. They are:\n1. Determination of an applicable resale price [subdivision (iv)]\n \n2. Determination of an appropriate markup. [subdivision (vi)]\n \n3. Reduction of the applicable resale price by the appropriate markup.\n \n4. Adjustment of the result under 3, above, as provided in subdivision (ix).\n \nIt is the fourth step that plaintiff has finessed.\n \nTreas. Reg. § 1.482–2(e)(3)(ix) provides:\nIn determining an arm’s length price appropriate adjustment must be made to reflect any material differences between the uncontrolled purchases and resales used as the basis for the calculation of the appropriate markup percentage and the resales of property involved in the controlled sale. The differences referred to in this subdivision are those differences in functions or circumstances which have a definite and reasonably ascertainable effect on price. * * *. [Emphasis added.]\n \n \nThe message of subdivision (ix) is simply that if there are any differences in functions or circumstances between DISA and the independents to which its gross margin is analogized, for appropriate markup purposes, have a definitely and reasonably ascertainable effect on price then such differences must be reflected by an adjustment to the price that is based only on an ‘applicable resale price’ reduced by an ‘appropriate markup.’\n \nIt must be presumed from the evidence that the businesses with which DISA is in apparent parity for gross margin purposes were fully independent operators who, as such, were necessarily exposed to all aspects of normal entrepreneurial risk, not the least of which is the risk of operating loss. At the same time, the evidence affirmatively shows that DISA was not similarly exposed.\n \nAs earlier shown in dealing with plaintiff’s first argument, one need look no further than its own experts, Drs. Stobaugh and Miller as well as Mr. Bower, to be well satisfied both that risk impacts directly on price and that the extent of that impact is at least generally ascertainable.\n \nSince the regulation on which plaintiff relies expressly mandates an adjustment to price that it has neither acknowledged nor made, its argument based on the regulation fails.\n \nIn summary, because plaintiff has been unable to prove that the prices at which it transferred goods to DISA were either the factual or legal equivalent of arm’s-length prices its challenge to the deficiencies imposed under section 482 must be rejected without regard to the expert testimony on which the Government has built its defense. This is the unmistakable teaching of Lilly, supra.\n \nNotwithstanding the above observation, the logical persuasiveness of defendant’s expert proof, coupled with the seeming incongruity of proof of that quality with the rigidity of the Commissioner’s regulations requires comment.\n \nDefendant called two experts. The proof adduced through them is detailed in findings 117–139, infra, and will not be reiterated here.\n \n*23 The analysis supplied by neither expert purported to be a ‘pricing method.’ The presentations were devoted, instead, to the development of profitability standards, extrapolated from ‘real world’ economic data, against which the normality of DISA’s profit experience could be measured. As such, the analyses were oriented to net profits.\n \nAt least where the sale of tangible property is involved, the Commissioner’s regulations seem to accommodate nothing short of a ‘pricing method’ to determine the question of an arm’s-length price. Treas. Reg. § 1.482–2(3)(e)(1)(iii). Moreover, as plaintiff has correctly noted, the regulation approach seems to rule out net profit as a relevant consideration in the determination of an arm’s-length price, this despite Congress’ encouragement to the contrary, as expressed in H. R. REP. No. 2508, 87th Cong. 2d Sess. 18–19 (1962) (Conference Report).\n \nAs evidenced by the magnitude of the record compiled in this case, the resolution by trial of a reallocation controversy under section 482 can be a very burdensome, time-consuming and obviously expensive process—especially if the stakes are high. A more manageable and expeditious means of resolution should be found. The evidence adduced in this case through Dr. Irving Plotkin, a skilled practioner of the discipline of econometrics, strongly suggests that the promulgation of universally applicable safehaven criteria to facilitate the administration of section 482 may now be both entirely feasible and eminently proper. The exercise performed by Dr. Plotkin is detailed in findings 125–139, infra. It merits thoughtful consideration.\n \n\nFindings of Fact\nI. Jurisdiction\n1. Plaintiff, E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company (Du Pont), is, and at all times hereafter mentioned has been, a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business located at Wilmington, Delaware.\n \n2. Plaintiff brings these suits, which have been consolidated for purposes of all proceedings in this court, to recover from the United States the sum of $4,122,538, or such greater amount to which plaintiff may be entitled, with interest as provided by law, which sum plaintiff contends to represent an overpayment of Federal income tax for the calendar year 1959, and the sum of $13,863,162, or such greater amount to which plaintiff may be entitled, with interest as provided by law, which sum plaintiff contends to represent an overpayment of Federal income tax for the calendar year 1960. Plaintiff has calculated that of the foregoing amounts of alleged overpayments, some $1,522,047 in 1959 and $7,834,610 in 1960 are attributable to the issues arising under section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, those being the only issues not heretofore disposed of by settlement or adjudication. E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Co. v. United States, 200 Ct. C. 391, 471 F. 2d 1211 (1973). The actions arise under the Internal Revenue laws of the United States and are brought pursuant to section 1491 of Title 28 of the United States Code and sections 6402 and 7422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954.\n \n*24 3. On June 15, 1960, plaintiff filed its Federal income tax return (Form 1120) for the calendar year 1959 with the District Director of Internal Revenue at Wilmington, Delaware, disclosing a tax liability of $282,182,705.39, which plaintiff timely paid to the said District Director.\n \n4. By timely consents in writing (Form 872) executed by plaintiff and the District Director of Internal Revenue at Wilmington, Delaware, the time for additional income tax assessments for 1959 was extended to December 31, 1964, and the time for filing claims for refund of Federal income tax for 1959 was extended to June 30, 1965.\n \n5. By a letter from the District Director of Internal Revenue at Wilmington, Delaware, dated December 11, 1964, transmitting an audit report dated the same day, plaintiff was advised of a proposed determination of an additional 1959 income tax liability in the amount of $10,070,912, and of the audit adjustments on which such determination was based. On December 21, 1964, plaintiff paid this amount to the said District Director, plus interest thereon in the amount of $2,880,143.\n \n6. On June 29, 1965, plaintiff filed with the District Director of Internal Revenue at Wilmington, Delaware, a timely claim for refund of overpayments of Federal income tax for the year 1959.\n \n7. More than 6 months elapsed after June 29, 1965, and before the filing of suit in No. 256–66, and plaintiff had not been advised as of that date by the Internal Revenue Service of either the allowance or disallowance of any part of its 1959 claim for refund.\n \n8. On June 15, 1961, plaintiff filed its Federal income tax return (Form 1120) for the calendar year 1960 with the District Director of Internal Revenue at Wilmington, Delaware, disclosing a tax liability of $243,018,253.97, which plaintiff timely paid to the said District Director.\n \n9. By timely consents in writing (Form 872) executed by plaintiff and the District Director of Internal Revenue at Wilmington, Delaware, the time for additional income tax assessments for 1960 was extended to December 31, 1965, and the time for filing claims for refund of Federal income tax for 1960 was extended to June 30, 1966.\n \n10. By a letter from the District Director of Internal Revenue at Wilmington, Delaware, dated November 8, 1965, transmitting an audit report dated October 29, 1965, plaintiff was advised of a proposed determination of an additional 1960 income tax liability in the amount of $21,634,969.56, and of the audit adjustments on which such determination was based. Plaintiff paid to the said District Director $9,687,600 of this additional 1960 tax, plus interest thereon in the amount of $2,189,264.89 on December 21, 1964, and the balance of the additional tax in the amount of $11,947,369.56, plus interest thereon in the amount of $3,386,506.45 on December 6, 1965.\n \n11. On February 9, 1966, plaintiff filed with the District Director of Internal Revenue at Wilmington, Delaware, a timely claim for refund of all overpayments of Federal income tax for the year 1960.\n \n*25 12. More than 6 months elapsed after February 9, 1966, and before the filing of suit in No. 371–66, and plaintiff had not been advised as of that date by the Internal Revenue Service of either the allowance or disallowance of any part of its 1960 claim for refund.\n \n\nII. The District Director’s Proposed Application of Section 482\n13. The audit of plaintiff’s 1959 corporation income tax return by the Internal Revenue Service extended over a period of almost 2 years and the audit for 1960 over a period of almost 19 months.\n \n14. Each of the two audits culminated in issuance of a 30-day letter by the District Director that, inter alia, proposed allocations of income to plaintiff from Du Pont de Nemours International S. A. (DISA) (plaintiff’s wholly-owned Swiss subsidiary) under the authority of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, in the amount of $2,927,014 for 1959 and $15,066,558 for 1960.\n \n15. The District Director’s method for 1959 was based on a calculation of a discount to DISA on its purchases from plaintiff. The discount resulted from the application to DISA of ratios of Du Pont’s total selling expenses (exclusive of advertising) and total administrative expenses to Du Pont’s total sales on a departmental basis. This discount of 5.65 percent was then applied to DISA’s 1959 actual net sales less commissions to sales representatives ($18,222,837) to produce an amount ($1,029,590) which was subtracted from DISA’s 1959 gross profit less commissions to sales representatives ($4,498,531). The amount so produced ($3,468,941) was reduced by an amount equal to DISA’s total advertising expenses plus a commission of 15 percent of the advertising expenses paid by DISA to parties other than plaintiff, which aggregated $541,927. The resulting amount ($2,927,014) was allocated to plaintiff’s income.\n \n16. The District Director’s method for 1960 began by calculating a standard ratio of net profits (i. e., profits before reduction by income taxes) to sales. This calculation was made by computing the average ratio of net profits to sales for all United States wholesalers of drugs, chemicals and allied products (with total assets between $5,000,000 and $250,000,000) that had reported taxable income on their United States corporation income tax returns for taxable period ending with or within the fiscal year ending June 30, 1961, as compiled by the Statistics Division of the Internal Revenue Service and recorded in the Source Book of Statistics of Income. This standard ratio, 4.8 percent, was then applied to the amount of DISA’s 1960 sales of plaintiff’s products. The amount by which DISA’s net profits exceeded the profit so computed was allocated to plaintiff’s income. For the taxable years 1961 through 1967, the District Director continued to apply the basic method used in 1960, substituting for each subsequent year a standard ratio of net profits to sales taken from the corresponding Source Book compilation of data for United States wholesalers of drugs, chemicals and allied products. The audits for the years 1966 and 1967 were completed December 1972.\n \n*26 17. DISA was subject to Swiss cantonal and federal defense taxes for 1959 and 1960. For 1959 DISA paid $449,029 in federal income tax and $190,484 in cantonal income tax, a total of $639,513. For 1960 DISA paid $1,008,452 in federal income tax and $1,023,273, in cantonal income tax, a total of $2,031,725.\n \n\nIII. Plaintiff’s Business and Its Organization\n18. According to a publication entitled ‘Du Pont’ put out by it in 1965, plaintiff is the world’s largest chemical company, Imperial Chemical Industries, Ltd. (ICI) being the second largest. In 1959 and 1960, as in earlier years, it manufactured and sold a wide variety of chemical products, including synthetic fibers, synthetic rubber, plastics, dyes, explosives, pigments, finishes, refrigerants, etc. While the product line has always included so-called commodity items such as sulfuric acid, ammonia, methyl and ethyl alcohol (items that are made to standard chemical specifications and are therefore customarily sold in bulk form within a relatively limited distance from the place of production and at highly competitive prices), the backbone of plaintiff’s business (which was founded on the manufacture of explosives) has increasingly become the manufacture and sale of what are known as proprietary products. These are products such as man-made fibers, neoprene, pigments, plastics, and packaging and industrial films, all of which are created by highly sophisticated formulations and processes that combine to produce special and frequently unique physical and chemical properties adapted to particular end-use requirements. It is in this area that plaintiff has been able to capitalize most profitably on its technological excellence.\n \nUntil the late 1950s plaintiff had no manufacturing facilities outside the Western Hemisphere and, for reasons that will later become apparent, its goods have traditionally been sold primarily in the domestic market. In 1958 plaintiff’s gross domestic sales totaled $1,723,656,000 and its gross export sales totaled $148,245,000. In addition, pursuant to the antitrust decree in the Imperial Chemical Industries, Ltd. (ICI) case, which resulted in division of companies in Canada and Latin America which were theretofore jointly owned by plaintiff and ICI, plaintiff gained sole control of a number of foreign subsidiaries engaged to a limited degree in some of these lines of business in Canada and several Latin American countries.\n \n19. In 1956 plaintiff organized its first wholly-owned subsidiary in Europe, Du Pont Company (United Kingdom) Limited (Du Pont (UK)). Initially, it engaged in the manufacture (under contract) and sale of urea herbicides in the United Kingdom. In late 1957 Du Pont (UK) began construction of a plant in Londonderry, Ireland, for the manufacture of neoprene synthetic rubber. The plant began production in 1960 and reached full production in 1961. Selection of both neoprene and a British Isles production site as plaintiff’s initial manufacturing undertaking in Europe is logically explained by the fact that a substantial market for neoprene in the British Empire had been established by ICI acting as plaintiff’s sales agent for neoprene in that area since 1935.  United States v. Imperial Chemical Industries, Ltd., 100 F. Supp. 504, 550–51 (S. D. N. Y. 1951).\n \n*27 20. In 1958 a wholly-owned subsidiary, Du Pont de Nemours (Belgium) S. A. (Du Pont (Belgium)), began construction of a plant at Mechelen, Belgium, for the manufacture of lacquers, enamels, paints, varnishes and thinners for the automobile, industrial, household and maintenance fields. The plant was built primarily to supply automotive finishes to a General Motors plant that was located in Belgium. Production began near the end of 1959.\n \n21. A wholly-owned subsidiary of plaintiff, Du Pont de Nemours (Nederland) N. V. (Du Pont (Nederland)), was organized early in 1959 and began construction of a plant in Dordrecht, Netherlands, for the manufacture of ‘Orlon’ acrylic fiber. Production at this plant commenced in December 1961. In 1960 Du Pont (Nederland) began construction of a plant at Dordrecht for the finishing and coloring of ‘Delrin’ acetal resin using semi-finished polymer sold to it by plaintiff; plant operations began in early 1963.\n \n22. In 1959 plaintiff organized Du Pont de Nemours (France) S. A. (Du Pont (France)), as a wholly-owned subsidiary for the manufacture (under contract) and sale of urea herbicides in France. Production operations commenced in 1960.\n \n23. Plans for a European-based pigments manufacturing plant were realized in late 1959 upon organization in Homburg, Germany, of Pigment-Chemie, G. m. b. H., in which plaintiff owned a 26 percent equity. The plant was completed and initial operations began in 1962.\n \n24. Plaintiff’s Board of Directors has both an Executive Committee and a Finance Committee. The Executive Committee, comprised of plaintiff’s president and seven or more of its vice presidents, functions as the operating arm of the board in the establishment of the basic policies that govern the conduct of plaintiff’s overall business. The responsibility of the Finance Committee pertains more particularly to the financial aspects of the business, such as the provision for and expenditure of capital funds. From January 19, 1948 until August 19, 1962, Crawford H. Greenewalt was plaintiff’s president, chairman of the Executive Committee and a member of the Finance Committee. His testimony, like that given by the other officers and employees of plaintiff who appeared in this proceeding, was uniformly forthright and totally credible. All pertinent facts based on such testimony have been found accordingly.\n \n25. There is great diversity among the many items comprising plaintiff’s entire product line. To achieve manageability plaintiff has created a series of separate and relatively autonomous departments with each having basic responsibility for the manufacture and merchandising of products generally related in character. There are 11 such industrial departments, each headed by a general manager whose functions, authority, and responsibilities within his department are fundamentally similar to those of a separate corporation’s president. The 11 industrial departments with specific product responsibility during the period in suit were: Elastomer Chemicals, Electro-chemicals, Explosives, Fabrics and Finishes, Film, Industrial and Biochemicals, Organic Chemicals, Photo Products, Pigments, Polychemicals (Plastics), and Textile Fibers. Because of an increased interest in the development of overseas business that was stimulated largely by Mr. Greenewalt, a 12th industrial department was created in 1958 when what had formerly been known as the Foreign Relations Department, a unit that had concerned itself primarily with patent licensing and had no manufacturing or sales responsibility, was reconstituted as the International Department and given important responsibilities in the areas of developing new manufacturing opportunities outside the United States, coordinating foreign trade development and export sales policy, and serving as liaison agent between the Executive Committee and the managements of plaintiff’s foreign subsidiaries and between the latter and plaintiff’s various industrial departments. Mr. W. S. Carpenter, III, a man well qualified by diversified experience in both production and sales in various of plaintiff’s industrial departments, was selected to be the first general manager of the International Department, a position that he held until 1970 when he became a corporate director and member of the Finance Committee. Complementing the 12 industrial departments are 13 staff departments, each providing professional advice and supporting services to the industrial departments and to other staff departments, as required. At the times pertinent to this suit those departments were Advertising, Central Research, Development, Economist, Employee Relations, Engineering, General Services, Legal, Public Relations, Purchasing, Secretary’s, Traffic, and Treasurer’s.\n \n*28 26. Historically, plaintiff has built its business on technology, both developed internally and purchased from outsiders, and manufacturing excellence. To help sustain that superior technology plaintiff maintains a research and development establishment employing several thousand engineers, chemists, scientists and other professionals engaged in basic or applied research at an annual cost of not less than two hundred million dollars. In addition to that basic research effort, aimed at the development of new products, each of plaintiff’s major industrial departments maintains extensive laboratory and testing facilities at Chestnut Run, near Wilmington, that render what plaintiff terms technical sales service. The Chestnut Run complex employs some 2,000 technical specialists. Its laboratories include pilot model reproductions of the manufacturing facilities used by various types of industrial customers throughout the world. For example, the laboratory of the Textile Fibers Department is equipped with 65 weaving, spinning and knitting machines that simulate field operating conditions in the textile industry. The principal mission of Chestnut Run is to constantly evaluate the potential for Du Pont products against the practical needs of the market place, to gather and disseminate new and useful technology to Du Pont customers and to assist those customers in solving any technical problems that they encounter in their use of Du Pont products. A prominent example of assistance to customers in the resolution of technical problems is found in the textile fiber area. Plaintiff produces literally thousands of distinct varieties of man-made fibers. Because the fabrication of each of those fibers into the thread, yarn or cloth necessary to the eventual production of a consumer item requires usually minor but always essential adjustments in the setup of the machinery used to accomplish those results, the demand on it for technical know-how in the further processing of its fibers is substantial. Gathering that know-how from its own trial-and-error experience under operating conditions simulating those in the field and imparting it to those working with its products is a very important part of plaintiff’s marketing program. While this type of activity is probably most extensive in the merchandising of man-made fibers, it is also required in the marketing of many other items in plaintiff’s broad product line.\n \nA major portion of the Chestnut Run effort is directed to the conception and development of new and profitable end uses that exploit the distinctive properties of plaintiff’s many and varied proprietary products, as distinguished from the standardized commodity items that simply do not lend themselves to many innovative applications. Mr. Greenewalt characterized this aspect of the Chestnut Run operation—the development of new uses for existing products—as being ‘really where we make our bread and butter.’ One of Chestnut Run’s accomplishments with Dacron is illustrative. Today’s accepted quality standard for men’s shirting material is a 65–35 percent blend of Dacron and cotton. Shirting material was one of the major uses that plaintiff envisioned for Dacron when it introduced the product to the market. Dacron-made shirts did not gain appreciable consumer acceptance, however, because they did not have an acceptable texture or ‘feel.’ At that point plaintiff undertook, on its own and without the assistance of the textile industry, a research effort directed to the perfection of a Dacron-bearing shirting fabric with broad market appeal. The effort, which culminated in the 65–35 percent blend, entailed test-mixing Dacron fiber with varying proportions of cotton staple, making thread, weaving fabrics and, finally, making and wear-testing shirts. While the effort required was extensive, the results achieved established a large market for Dacron. Plaintiff made similar efforts and attained comparable success in developing a multitude of end uses for neoprene that capitalized on its discrete properties, such as ozone resistance. The development of acrylic finishes for automobiles is still another example of the fruits of plaintiff’s technical service efforts at Chestnut Run.\n \n*29 27. By 1960 plaintiff had spent almost three hundred million dollars on research and development for neoprene, nylon, Dacron and Orlon, four of plaintiff’s principal product lines of a proprietary nature and the four that also accounted for the bulk of its export business. To implement the results of those research and development efforts plaintiff’s gross investment in plant and equipment for the production of those lines was as follows by 1959:\n \n\n\n\n\nNeoprene\t\n \n|$ 69,081,000\n \n|\nNylon (Inclusive of facilities for the manufacture of intermediates)\t\n \n|319,654,000\n \n|\nDacron\t\n \n|97,834,000\n \n|\nOrlon\t\n \n|93,942,000\n \n|\n\n\n\n\n28. At approximate cost, plaintiff’s total investment in plant and properties was roughly two billion dollars in 1959 and two billion two hundred million dollars in 1960. Its operating investment (current assets plus plant and properties) averaged two billion seven hundred thousand dollars in 1959 and two billion nine hundred thousand dollars in 1960.\n \n29. Traditionally, plaintiff has met its capital requirements with internally generated funds rather than funded debt or equity financing. In keeping with this conservatism plaintiff has always looked to return on investment as the central criterion for the expenditure of capital funds.\n \n30.

As borne out by the comparative profitability results shown in the preceding finding, plaintiff did not operate its export business as a vehicle for disposing of its products on a marginally-priced basis.\n \n\nIV. Plaintiff’s Sales Policies and Programs\nA. Foreign Sales. 33. Until the mid-1950s, for reasons that will follow, plaintiff concentrated its production and marketing efforts on servicing the United States market. From 1897 until the post-World War II era the geographic contours of plaintiff’s market were shaped by the terms of various agreements and understandings between itself and ICI. In United States v. Imperial Chemical Industries, Ltd., 100 F. Supp. 504 (S. D. N. Y. 1951), a proceeding brought by the Government on January 6, 1944 charging plaintiff, ICI, two other corporations and five corporate officers with violations of section 1 of the Sherman Act, the court found that plaintiff and ICI had effectively allocated world markets among themselves and others by a series of territorially oriented patent and process agreements and by the establishment of joint ventures in production facilities in Canada, Chile, Brazil, and Argentina.\n \nWith the United States as the major market apportioned exclusively to plaintiff under its compacts with ICI and with the constraints in exports by it to the British Empire and Europe imposed thereby, it is understandable that throughout the period mentioned plaintiff’s productive capacity was geared to supplying domestic demand. That approach was clearly reflected in the formal policy pronouncements of plaintiff’s Executive Committee, such as its resolutions of November 1, 1944 and January 29, 1947. With the onset of World War II defense procurement preempted plaintiff’s productive capacity. The return to a peacetime economy brought with it a boom that was fueled by the release of a great reservoir of consumer demand and capital that had accumulated during the years of enforced subordination of civilian needs to mailitary priorities. For the most part, the resultant domestic market for plaintiff’s products equaled or exceeded its ability to produce, this despite significant postwar additions to its production facilities. This climate obtained until the mid-1905s when an apparent leveling off occurred. Meanwhile, in 1948 plaintiff and ICI, anticipating some of the determinations that later materialized in the antitrust proceeding, canceled many of the patent and process agreements on which their division of world markets had been founded and plaintiff established some foreign sales agencies (i. e., independent distributors) to solicit business in overseas markets from which it had previously been foreclosed by its agreements with ICI. Because of the strong and sustained domestic demand that followed World War II, as earlier mentioned, exports of plaintiff’s goods during that period was generally limited to so-called opportunistic sales. Such casual sales usually occurred when an overseas producer or user of a product generically similar to one produced by plaintiff was unable to meet a sales commitment or need and plaintiff’s inventory of the product involved temporarily exceeded its own requirements for the domestic market. Except in the areas of dyestuffs and neoprene, however, plaintiff produced no products for overseas consumption during this era. In 1949 plaintiff established a two-man office in Basel, Switzerland, to furnish technical assistance to its distributors’ European textile chemical (dyestuff) customers. By 1956 the staff had been increased to four with the addition of a biochemist who performed a similar function in the biochemical (then known as Grasselli) area and another man who worked with customers for plaintiff’s Freon products. In addition, at one time during the 1949–1956 period two technicians worked out of the Basel office rendering assistance to European users of plaintiff’s elastomer products.\n \n*32 In 1952, at the conclusion of a subsequent proceeding on remedy, the court in the antitrust litigation nullified all restrictive arrangements between plaintiff and ICI. United States v. Imperial Chemical Industries, Ltd., 105 F. Supp. 215 (S. D. N. Y. 1952). It did so by a combination of injunctive measures and enforced separation of the respective equity interests of plaintiff and ICI in such jointly-owned overseas manufacturing ventures as Canadian Industries, Ltd. (plaintiff’s distributive share of whose properties was to form the nucleus of the entity thereafter known as Du Pont of Canada). Duperial-Argentina and Duperial-Brazil. While plaintiff was thus effectively freed of preexisting contractual constraints on marketing its products in Europe, it found competition there progressively increasing in intensity as the established European chemical companies recovered from the effects of the war and participated fully in the general industrial resurgence that followed thereafter. Such companies were Bayer, BASF and Hoechst in Germany, Rhone-Poulene in France, Montecatini in Italy, and plaintiff’s former ally, ICI, in England. In addition, many of plaintiff’s domestic competitors such as Monsanto, Union Carbide, Dow, Rohm & Haas, Hercules, Atlas, and Celanese were actively pursuing European business.\n \nA leveling off of demand for plaintiff’s products in the United States market became foreseeable not long after its divorce from ICI. That prospect materialized by 1956 when plaintiff’s domestic sales fell below those of a year earlier. Finding 30, supra. Overseas sales, even though not supported by a well-orchestrated marketing program, were meanwhile trending strongly upward. These circumstances convinced Mr. Greenewalt that foreign markets represented a prime source of potential for the future growth of his company. He viewed the opportunistic sales of United States-produced goods that were then accounting for the healthy annual increases in overseas volume as a temporary bonanza that would only endure until local production of competitive goods in the consuming areas came to pass. He firmly believed that the kind of worthwhile customers on which a sound overseas business could be built would not indefinitely patronize a source of supply that was many thousands of miles removed from them once they were able to secure products of at least reasonable equivalence from nearby sources. From the outset, then, in Mr. Greenewalt’s mind the effective realization of foreign market potential entailed the establishment of manufacturing capability in the markets to be served. The immediate problem in coping with that requirement was that few, if any, countries in either Europe or South America offered a sufficiently large volume of market potential to justify the construction of plant facilities large enough to achieve attractive economies of scale. While that condition has largely persisted in the case of South America, with the result that plaintiff has not directed any really broad-based sales efforts at the 22-odd countries located there, the problem was solved as to Europe by the 1957 Treaty of Rome. That compact formally established the European Economic Community or so-called Common Market. By its terms, Belgium, Luxembourg, France, Germany, Italy and the Netherlands resolved themselves into a single trading community with integrated economic and financial policies. A market of some two hundred million people, the approximate population size of the United States market, was thereby created. The buying potential of that market was clearly sufficiently large to justify the construction of plant facilities on an economically feasible scale. Mr. Greenewalt sumarized the significance of the Common Market to plaintiff in the following words: ‘So that the advent of the common market really created a market that was essentially the size of the United States market. And this gave us an opportunity that we—it simply hadn’t existed before. But this opportunity really was more in the—in manufacturing than it was in selling, because it enabled us to put a plant in one little corner of Europe, for example, the Orlon plant in Holland, where the amount of Orlon that Holland, itself, requires you could put in your eye. But you could sell from that plant throughout the entire comon market without duties, without customs barriers, and so this really enabled you to do a manufacturing job on a scale that was reasonably adequate.’ For plaintiff’s future sales prospects in Europe the advent of the Common Market had implications beyond the affirmative opportunity that Mr. Greenewalt perceived. Obviously, plaintiff’s European and multinational competitors were presented with the same manufacturing opportunities that plaintiff was. It was therefore apparent that in the future plaintiff’s competition in the European market would increasingly come from locally-produced goods. In addition to offering the trade the reassurance of a more accessible and agreeably, therefore, a more reliable source of supply, such goods would enjoy material cost advantages over competing United States-produced merchandise that would be subject to substantial transportation and tariff charges. Domestically-produced proprietary items were also subject to the further handicap of being manufactured to meet the particular preference of the United States market—preferences that frequently differ from those of European users of the same basic item, such as a type of textile fiber. Recognition of these factors caused Mr. Greenewalt and his like-minded, subordinate executives to regard eventual European manufacture as an absolute prerequisite to a successful and lasting penetration of that market. Attainment of that operating objective harmonized with plaintiff’s established policy of not constructing domestic manufacturing capacity to service overseas markets. At the trial Mr. Carpenter testified that he knew of no instance in which production facilities were constructed in this country to provide goods for export.\n \n*33 B. Domestic Sales. 34. Consumer items such as household paints, automotive-care products and antifreeze represent only a very small part of plaintiff’s total product line. Most of the proprietary products (and all of the commodity-type items) that plaintiff sells are used by other manufacturers as raw material ingredients of their own operations. In some instances, as in the case of textile fibers, the product that plaintiff sells typically passes through several different manufacturing hands to create the shirt, sweater or dress that the consumer buys.\n \n35. Because of the nature of its product line, plaintiff’s selling efforts on the domestic market have traditionally been technically rather than promotionally oriented. Under that approach the emphasis is not on the unit price at which plaintiff is willing to sell one of its proprietary products, but on the value superiority of the item that the purchaser is able to produce by utilizing it in a cost-efficient manner that will be technically adequate to adapt it to a desired end use. The role of an effective salesman in that type of selling effort is primarily that of a product engineer. In addition to the conventional attributes of good salesmanship he must have at least enough technical competence in his own right to be able to understand the basics of the customer’s operation and capabilities as related to use of the product that he is trying to sell. He must also have ready access to a reservoir of technology that can provide answers to those questions that are beyond his own competence. With this type merchandising requirement, independent distributors have accounted for less than 1 percent of plaintiff’s domestic sales. Instead, each of the industrial departments has maintained its own sales force of technically trained representatives. Until the late 1940s the domestic selling effort was largely confined to having such representatives maintain contact with plaintiff’s immediate customers, soliciting orders from them and providing liaison with Chestnut Run for the referral of those technical matters on which a customer requested assistance.\n \nBeginning in the late 1940s the Textile Fibers Department, plaintiff’s largest industrial department, embarked on a program of market analysis the object of which was to gain specific identification of the various end uses to which the fibers that it sold were ultimately put and to familiarize itself with the particulars of the manufacturing and distribution structure through which such fibers passed en route to the point of final sale. The end-use information was desired so that plaintiff’s fibers could be manufactured specifically to best fit the particular requirements of each of the products in which they were to be used. For example, the rubber industry purchased large quantities of plaintiff’s industrial rayon fiber called Cordura. That fiber is used in the manufacture of many different items including tires, V-belts and hose. Optimum performance of each of those items requires small but important variations in the make-up of the Cordura that is used. If plaintiff knows in advance the use to which the Cordura will be put it is able to provide those variations by appropriate adjustments to its manufacturing processes. The desirability, from the standpoint of sales appeal, of being able to tailor the raw material ingredient to meet the particular performance needs of the end item to be made from it applies equally in the case of most all proprietary products manufactured by plaintiff. Accordingly, the concept of willingness and ability to engineer its products to fit the specific style or performance requirements of the items to be made from them has become an integral part of plaintiff’s marketing strategy.\n \n*34 When the Textile Fibers Department surveyed the distribution structure through which those of its products that were used to make wearing apparel passed en route to the consumer, it discovered that there were many points along that route at which it could direct promotional effort that could influence the buying preferences of its immediate customers. The objective was to cause the customers of plaintiff’s customers to request that they be supplied yarns or fabrics made from plaintiff’s fibers because they believed that those fabrics and yarns either lent themselves more readily to the processing or fabricating operations that they were performing or provided them with a more appealing and therefore more profitable product to sell, or both. Whereas the department had done little or no advertising directed to knitters and weavers, it found that a coordinated program of retail advertisement of apparel containing Du Pont fibers stimulated a demand among retailers that was eventually reflected in the buying preferences of the knitters and weavers, which, in turn, radiated back to plaintiff’s own customers.\n \nThe essential ingredients of the intergrated strategy that plaintiff has employed to successfully market its proprietary products in the United States since the late forties may be summarized as a close liaison between its own sales personnel and the reservoir of product innovation and technical assistance available at Chestnut Run for the benefit of both customers and their customers reinforced by (1) a continuing identification of the uses to which its products be put and a willingness and ability to modify those products as necessary to best adapt them to their intended use and (2) a comprehensive advertising and promotional effort directed to each point in the chain of distribution at which demand for the products that plaintiff produces can be effectively stimulated.\n \nThe necessary investment of time and resources that are frequently justifiable only in terms of long-range rather than immediate profit returns and the disclosure of proprietary information often essential to enabling specially qualified sales representatives to effectively perform their assigned liaison and technical assistance functions are prominent among the considerations that tend to rule out independent distributors as both a willing and able means of implementing plaintiff’s fundamental sales strategy.\n \n\nV. The Establishment of DISA\n36. By 1957 Mr. Greenewalt had succeeded in convincing a majority of the members of the Executive Committee that the advisability of plaintiff’s assuming a more active participation in foreign markets, particularly in Europe, merited thorough investigation and consideration. To that end, the committee’s first action was to request the Development Department to examine and report its findings on the various organizational structures used by ICI and eight American corporations, including such direct competitors as Union Carbide and Monsanto, to conduct their foreign operations. In an extensive report of May 31, 1957, the Development Department summarized its findings as follows:\n*35 A centralized organization for the conduct of foreign business was recommended by most of the companies studied. However, on analyzing their individual problems, two opposing requirements are found which, while present in all companies, are readily apparent only in the case of the large diversified companies such as Union Carbide and Monsanto.\n \nThe first requirement is the need for coordination of those matters unique to the conduct of business abroad, which calls for some kind of centralized organizational ties. The second requirement is the need for coordination of those matters involving the technology and business know-how of a specific domestic division of the company, such as technical liaison, pricing, and production scheduling. This latter requirement involves decentralizing organizational ties.\n \nMost of the companies contacted have elected to emphasize the centralized type of organization for their foreign business. In one way or another, however, they have provided strong, coordinating ties with the domestic divisions involved. Hence such activities as finance, personnel, and direct sales are usually centralized. At the same time, a close tie-in to the domestic product groups is provided through product managers who recognize strong responsibilities to the domestic divisions, even though the chart lines may not show it.\n \nFor the diversified companies using return-on-investment as a major criterion, an important aspect of their organizations appeared to be handling of incentives for the domestic product groups. Here, three features stood out, namely, (a) seeing that the domestic groups receive the major profits, not only from export sales, but also from foreign manufacture; (b) having a tax-haven subsidiary which permits the use of essentially tax-free dollars in making foreign investments; and (c) having the support of top management.\n \nIf the incentives are right, the other important elements, such as having a highlevel spokesman for foreign business, assigning clear responsibility for foreign business, assigning clear responsibility for initiating new foreign ventures, coordinating export sales with foreign manufacture, having engineers adapted to think in terms of small-scale plants, and handling finance and personnel matters, seem to work themselves out satisfactorily.\n \nThe history of the Du Pont Export Company during the period 1919 to 1922 was so greatly influenced by the inexperience of its personnel, the drastic depression of 1921, and the concurrent reorganization of the entire du Pont Company, as to be of little value as an example of a consolidated export sales organization.\n \n \n37. Mr. Greenewalt recognized that an absolute prerequisite to the success of a foreign sales program, however organized, was the enthusiastic support of the industrial departments’ managers. Accordingly, the Foreign Relations Department was commissioned to undertake a study intended to identify those measures likely to generate such support. In performing this assignment the department consulted with all of the industrial departments’ general managers and with representatives of the Development, Legal and Treasurer’s Departments. The Foreign Relations Department’s report to the Executive Committee underwent various draft revisions. One of those drafts was dated August 12, 1957, and the evidence shows that the employment of a tax haven subsidiary as a device to generate funds free of United States tax to be used for overseas investment was among the possibilities considered as a means of providing incentive for industrial department support of foreign business. The matter was the subject of the following memorandum of August 16, 1957, by Mr. W. F. Lewis of the Tax Division of the Treasurer’s Department:\n \n\n\nOutline to Be Used for Preliminary Discussions of the Second Paragraph on Page 17 of Foreign Relations Department’s ‘Foreign Investments—Incentives to Industrial Departments’ August 12, 1957 Draft of Report to the Executive Committee\n\nI. ABOVE-MENTIONED PARAGRAPH READS AS FOLLOWS:\n*36 ‘The Treasurer’s Department is giving active study as to whether is would be feasible from the standpoint of internal accounting and tax considerations to transfer goods to a tax haven subsidiary at prices less than such transfers would be made to other subsidiaries or Industrial Departments, thus generating funds for investment.’\n \n\n\nII. ‘FAIR’ RATHER THAN ‘ARM’S LENGTH’ TRANSFER PRICE\nThe following is from ‘Federal Taxation of Income from Foreign Sources’ by Russell Baker (Copy available in Tax Division):\n‘It is sometimes said that the price which the parent receives for the goods from the foreign subsidiary must be the same as that which it would charge an unrelated party; that the dealings between the two must be ‘at arm’s length.’ This is not a very realistic approach to the problem. By definition, the dealings between a parent and its subsidiary can never be at arm’s length because there is a whole galaxy of factors involved in the case we are discussing which simply do not and cannot exist between two totally unrelated companies.\n \n‘A better approach is to say that the dealings between the two companies must be fair. The price which the parent charges the subsidiary for the goods must be fair. What is a fair price depends upon the facts of each particular situation. Taxpayers have been sustained where goods have been transferred at cost from the parent to its foreign subsidiary. This, of course, was a special situation. It is mentioned for the purpose of illustrating that there is no fixed percentage that must be added to the parent’s cost of goods in order to reach a sustainable inter-company price.’\n \nMr. Baker concludes this section of his article by stating that the transfer price ‘extends at one end from a price so high that the subsidiary can make no money to the other end where the price is so low that the parent recovers its costs only. Somewhere in between those two extremes, in the ordinary case, the ‘fair price’ on the transfer of the goods is to be found.’\n \n \n\n\nIII. SALE PRICE TO DISTRIBUTOR—EXPERIENCE VS. NO EXPERIENCE\nIf there is no current independent distributorship prices, there seems to be more leeway in establishing sale price for such products to the tax haven subsidiary than with respect to products which we currently sell through independent distributors.\n \n\n\nIV. WRITE FOR THE RECORD\nStatements explaining the establishment of sales prices to the tax haven subsidiary would be helpful in sustaining such prices for tax purposes. These statements should include:\n(1) Comment with respect to the lower unit costs of the products which results from the export sales;\n \n(2) the fact that the purchasing power is low in the foreign countries;\n \n(3) the desirability of becoming established in the foreign countries so that du Pont will gradually benefit from the industrialization of the foreign countries; etc.\n \n \n\n\nV. PROBABILITY OF CHALLENGE AND PROBABILITY OF SUCCESSFUL DEFENSE IF CHALLENGED\n‘A Case History of Section 45’ (Section 482 of 1954 Code) by Samuel Joyce Sherman (January, 1951 ‘Taxes—The Tax Magazine’) states that only 43 cases have been decided since Section 45 was first introduced into the 1928 act. Six of these cases involved sales or transfers of assets between related taxpayers. It appears that the government won three of these cases which involved ‘artifical price unrelated to fair market value’ and the taxpayers won three cases which involved property sold or transferred at ‘fair market value.’\n*37 It is felt that a revenue agent probably would not seriously question the transfer price unless:\n \n(1) it was obviously unfair or\n \n(2) the income concerned was material in amount.\n \nLogical pricing (See III above) and the availability of statements to support the prices (See IV above) could be very helpful in sustaining the prices—especially on the revenue agent level.\n \n \n\n\nVI. CONCLUSION\nIt would seem to be desirable to bill the tax haven subsidiary at less than an ‘arm’s length’ price because:\n(1) the pricing might not be challenged by the revenue agent;\n \n(2) if the pricing is challenged, we might sustain such transfer prices;\n \n(3) if we cannot sustain the prices used, a transfer price will be negotiated which should not be more than an ‘arm’s length’ price and might well be less; thus we would be no worse off than we would have been had we billed at the higher price.\n \n \n38. The Foreign Relations Department submitted its findings and recommendations to the Executive Committee in a report dated September 10, 1957. The report, the final version of which did not refer to the matter of a tax haven subsidiary or intercompany pricing, concluded with the following observations and recommendations:\nBroadly speaking, the General Managers have lacked interest in the development of foreign manufacturing businesses in the postwar period. However, there is currently noticeable active interest in such proposals.\n \n \nIn order to increase the interest and support of the Industrial Departments, it is recommended that:\n \n\n\n1) Policy Directive Incentive:\nThe Executive Committee should advise the Industrial Departments that it is prepared to approve (subject to the same criteria as used in judging domestic projects) attractive projects for investment in countries considered to offer a favorable climate for private investment.\nExecutive Committee Resolutions of Nov. 1, 1944 and Jan. 29, 1947 (quoted in Exhibit I) should be rescinded to elminate the implication hitherto existing of disinterest in the aggressive development of foreign business.\n \n \n\n\n2) Responsibility Incentive:\nThe Industrial Departments should be assigned responsibility for guiding the world-wide development of products within their respective fields. In the case of foreign manufacturing operations, this responsibility should be exercised jointly with the Foreign Relations Department or Management of the Subsidiary Company, as the case might be, to whom however would be delegated authority for operating the business. Further, the Industrial Departments should be provided with assistance in those areas that are peculiar to foreign business in a manner affirmatively attractive to them and at the same time providing a degree of coordination beyond that now existing. A study to these ends should be made, including the devising of reporting procedures designed to inform the Executive Committee and the General Managers of results of foreign operations on an Industrial Department product basis.\n \n\n\n3) Profit-Sharing Incentive:\n*38 It is recommended that figures showing return on foreign manufacturing investments be shown on a memorandum basis in Exhibit ‘B’ of the Industrial Departments’ Monthly Reports, in order to bring out world-wide profit results on an Industrial Department product basis.\nThe present form of royalty and profit-sharing arrangements are not effective in obtaining maximum interest of the Departments in the initiation and support of foreign operations. As the General Managers believe that the recommended policy and responsibility incentives will be sufficiently effective, it is unnecessary at the present time to consider expansion of such arrangements.\n \n \n39. By a memorandum dated November 15, 1957, stating: ‘It seems to me that the attached memorandum would add to the foundation and background for thinking about our foreign and export business,’ Du Pont’s treasurer, Mr. R. R. Pippin, transmitted to the Executive Committee a nine-page memorandum of November 7, 1957, prepared by plaintiff’s comptroller and entitled ‘USE OF A PROFIT SANCTUARY COMPANY BY THE DU PONT COMPANY.’ Pertinent portions of that memorandum stated as follows:\n \n\n\nGENERAL COMMENTS ON PROFIT SANCTUARIES FROM A CORPORATE STANDPOINT\nA ‘profit sanctuary’ country (sometimes referred to as a ‘tax haven’ or ‘base country’) has been defined as a country which imposes only negligible income or capital taxes, or no taxes at all, on income of its domestic corporations derived from sources outside the profit sanctuary country.\nA ‘profit sanctuary’ company is usually a company wholly-owned by a U. S. parent and established in a ‘profit sanctuary’ country to do business elsewhere in the world, with the objective of accumulating foreign earnings free from U. S. tax for reinvestment in foreign areas as opportunities arise. A profit sanctuary company would be subject to U. S. income tax only on the portion of its income, if any, arising from U. S. sources. Of course, dividends paid to a U. S. parent company by a profit sanctuary subsidiary would be subject to U. S. income tax (currently 52% for du Pont Company, less foreign tax credit, if any, for taxes paid, or deemed to have been paid, by the profit sanctuary company or its subsidiaries to governments other than the U. S.).\n \nSome of the more important reasons advanced for the formation of profit sanctuary companies follow:\n \n(A) Certain foreign income of a U. S. parent company (e. g., a portion of the profit on export sales) might be diverted so that it was earned by the profit sanctuary company and thus accumulated substantially or wholly tax-free for subsequent use in expansion of foreign investment. This income, if accumulated directly by a U. S. company and exported for foreign investment, would first be subject to the 52% of U. S. corporate income tax and thus reduced to 48¢ on the dollar. The ability to utilize the full dollar value of such funds by means of a profit sanctuary company may partially or wholly offset the greater risks inherent in foreign investments.\n \n*39 The extent to which additional funds might be made available for foreign investment by channelling dividends from foreign subsidiaries and foreign royalties through a profit sanctuary company would depend upon the extent to which the combined amount of U. S. and foreign taxes assessed upon such income when received directly by a U. S company exceeds the amount of foreign taxes assessed when received by a profit sanctuary company.\n \n* * *\n \n \n\nCompany to Sell du Pont Products in the Foreign Market\nIt is our opinion that a profit sanctuary trading company formed to sell du Pont products in foreign markets could be organized tax-free, since many valid business reasons could be advanced to support the formation of such a company. However, the profit sanctuary company would actually have to perform the selling functions and could not just be a ‘paper’ organization. We believe that, to assure the tax-free channelling of a portion of the profits on export sales to a profit sanctuary company, the Company’s administrative structure would have to be changed to achieve a bona fide shift of primary responsibility for export sales from the industrial departments to the new company. This would probably include the transfer to the profit sanctuary company of sales personnel now assigned to export sales. If such a trading subsidiary were formed, however, the possibility of transferring foreign patents (and perhaps even du Pont’s stockholdings in its foreign subsidiaries) to the subsidiary without the incidence of U. S. tax would be enhanced.\n \nThe total manufacturing and selling profit arising from export sales is estimated to be currently about $30MM per year before Federal taxes on income. The portion of this profit which could be realized by the profit sanctuary trading company, free of U. S. income tax, would depend upon the extent to which export sales can be funnelled through the trading company and upon the price level at which du Pont products were sold to that company. Authorities have stated that such transfer prices must be ‘fair’ and that ‘fair’ prices depend upon the facts of each particular situation—especially the scope of the functions performed by the transferee. If there are no established prices for sales of certain products to independent distributors who perform functions comparable to those which would be performed by the profit sanctuary company, there seems to be more leeway in setting transfer prices for such products. As a practical matter, if such a trading company were formed, we would recommend that the profit sanctuary subsidiary be billed at prices lower than those at which transfers or sales are being made to existing subsidiaries, industrial departments or independent sales companies. Although there is some risk, we believe there is a good chance that this position might be sustained opposite the Internal Revenue Service for U. S. income tax purposes in view of lower selling expense, greater volume, etc.\n \n* * *\n \n\nConclusion\n*40 Recent import barriers necessitated the formation of Du Pont de Venezuela and have resulted in studies being made to decide whether or not to make investments in Colombia, the Philippine Islands and, because of the European ‘common market’, various countries in Europe. This trend is expected to continue. The principal advantage of a profit sanctuary company is the possibility of accumulating funds abroad for reinvestment in such foreign ventures without incidence of U. S. tax. Insofar as the du Pont Company is concerned, it currently appears that a significant amount of funds could be thus accumulated to advantage only by means of a trading company through which our export sales could be funnelled. If the Company’s management foresees the future need and desirability of investing significant amounts in foreign ventures, and if management is willing to make the changes in administrative structure that would appear to be necessary to effect a bona fide transfer of the export selling functions to a profit sanctuary trading company, a profit sanctuary subsidary for accumulation of tax-free funds is sufficiently attractive to warrant further study on this subject.\n \nIt should be borne in mind, however, that a study to come up with a definitive recommendation regarding a profit sanctuary company would entail considerable time and effort on the part of a number of departments, including Foreign Relations, Development, Legal, Treasurer’s and the industrial departments. The problems to be resolved would include selection of the country of incorporation (e. g., there are over 40 countries which grant some form of complete or practically complete tax relief on income from sources outside the country), effect of tax conventions among countries of the world, scope of activities of the profit sanctuary company, the assets to be transferred, administrative organization and personnel requirements of the new company, required changes in administrative structure of the parent company, etc. [Emphasis added.]\n \n40. On December 26, 1957, the Executive Committee responded to the first of the three recommendations advanced by the Foreign Relations Department, as reflected in finding 38, supra, by rescinding its 1944 and 1947 resolutions (the first imposing outright prohibitions and the second stringent rate-of-return preconditions on investment in additional manufacturing facilities built to produce goods for sale in foreign markets) and adopting the following resolution as the policy guideline for the conduct of foreign business in the future:\n(1) that all reasonable effort should be made to maximize export sales consistent with adequate dollar profits;\n \n(2) that projects for manufacturing investments in foreign countries, where a favorable climate for long term private investment with satisfactory earnings prospects is indicated, will be considered on a case by case basis;\n \n(3) that in those countries where company subsidiaries currently operate, consideration should be given (a) to expansion of existing businesses where reasonable expectation of a satisfactory profit exists, and (b) to examination of possibilities for profitable expansion into new fields whether or not involving du Pont Company know-how and rights provided that in the latter case such new fields offer some business relationship (through production, sales or technology) to the local existing activities[.]\n \n \n*41 41. On January 8, 1958, the name of the Foreign Relations Department having already been changed to the International Department, the Executive Committee adopted the following self-explanatory resolution:\nWHEREAS, the Executive Committee on December 26, 1957 adopted resolution regarding ‘Policy with Respect to Export Sales from the United States and Manufacturing Investments in Foreign Countries’ which resolution was unanimously approved by the Finance Committee on January 3, 1958;\n \nRESOLVED, to implement the foregoing policy, the Executive Committee assigns—\n \n1) to each Industrial Department direct responsibility for export sales from the United States in its field of business;\n \n2) to the International Department direct responsibility for—\n \n(a) liaison between managements of foreign subsidiaries and the Executive Committee, with due regard for the responsibility of each subsidiary’s Board of Directors;\n \n(b) liaison between managements of foreign subsidiaries and the Industrial and Auxiliary Departments; including promotion of interchange of information on technical, process and patent matters consistent with legal and corporate requirements, and initiation of cooperative program with Industrial Departments and Employee Relations Department for training and development of foreign nationals to achieve maximum self-sufficiency in their respective units;\n \n(c) action as coordinator of foreign trade development and adviser on export sales policy including consultation with the Industrial Departments on the appointment or change of any agent or distributor in foreign countries;\n \n(d) action as coordinator of foreign licensing matters including consultation with Industrial Departments previous to negotiation of agreements involving disposition of foreign rights;\n \n(e) initiation of market surveys and preparation of cost estimates and projects for new facilities with the assistance of foreign subsidiaries and the Industrial Departments where indicated;\n \nRESOLVED FURTHER, to make this implementation of policy fully effective, the interest and support of the Industrial Departments will be required in all phases of sales and of investments in production facilities in foreign countries pertinent to their departmental interests, including establishment through the International Department of avenues of communication, either by visits of personnel or by receipt and analysis of operating reports or by both, to insure that all proper parent company technology or know-how is made available to foreign subsidiaries.\n \n \n42. On March 10, 1958, the assistant director of the International Department sent each of the industrial department general managers a memorandum (with the referenced attachment) entitled EXPORT SALES THROUGH TAX SANCTUARY COMPANY. Copies of these materials were also directed to all members of the Executive Committee, to the treasurer and director of the Legal Department and to various other staff department heads. In pertinent part, the assistant director’s three-page summary memorandum stated:\n*42 The possibility of utilizing a foreign tax sanctuary company for holding our foreign manufacturing investments and as a channel for export sales has been considered from time to time.\n \n* * *\n \nWith increased interest in new foreign investment greater attention has been given to this method of accumulating tax free earnings through so handling export sales. In connection with the study of ‘Orlon’ acrylic fiber manufacture in Europe data were collected showing that significant additional earnings could have been accumulated in 1957 to finance that investment.\n \nAttached is a copy of a joint memorandum from the Legal and Treasurer’s Departments indicating, based upon preliminary calculations, that it would have been possible to accumulate for new foreign investment somewhere between $1.8MM and $5.MM through savings in taxes on profits from 1957 export sales in Europe and Latin America, which under our present method of conducting business must be paid as taxes to the United States Treasury. Savings could be even larger. This calculation is based upon use of a Swiss Holding Company and Selling Companies in Switzerland and Bermuda. Use of companies in other countries and inclusion of all export sales could result in substantially larger tax savings. As pointed out in this memorandum, since many large United States companies, including important competitors, are operating in this way our failure to utilize such savings may place us at a disadvantage.\n \n* * *\n \nTo be successful, use of a tax sanctuary for export sales would require the wholehearted support of each Industrial Department. If you agree that the use of a tax sanctuary is sufficiently attractive, we propose to assemble a task force to study this problem intensively. In addition to the legal and financial problems all the practical day to day business problems which might be involved would be investigated thoroughly either through consultation, or through loan of an Industrial Department employee experienced in export sales.\n \nPlease let me have your thoughts on the desirability of so proceeding.\n \n \nThe attachment to the above memorandum, a nine-page memorandum dated March 7, 1958 and entitled USE OF A PROFIT SANCTUARY COMPANY BY THE DU PONT COMPANY prepared by Mr. Roy A. Wentz, Jr. of the Legal Department and Mr. George W. Morris of the Treasurer’s Department, borrowed heavily from the comptroller’s memorandum of November 7, 1957, as detailed in finding 39, supra. Among the additional observations and proposals advanced were the following:\n \n\n\nINTRODUCTION\nDue to the possibility of diverting amounts presently paid as U. S. income tax to investments in foreign countries through use of a ‘profit sanctuary company’, considerable interest has been expressed in the feasibility of du Pont forming and utilizing such a company.\nThis report deals with the general concept of ‘profit sanctuary companies’ and the areas of du Pont operations wherein their use might be feasible. Its objective is to determine whether, in view of the possibility of operations abroad requiring investment of substantial amounts, there is sufficient initial interest to warrant an exhaustive study, involving all interested departments, which study would be required before definitive recommendations could be made.\n \n*43 * * *\n \nA profit sanctuary company can be set up without U. S. tax risk. While it is possible that the benefits expected may not be fully realized if the bona fides of an operation cannot be satisfactorily proved, the probability of improving the volume of funds available for investment abroad seems so great that the risk of nonrealization of expected benefits should not turn us away from an intensive study of the advantages and disadvantages of forming and utilizing a profit sanctuary company or companies.\n \n* * *\n \n \n\n\nUTILIZATION BY THE DU PONT COMPANY\nAs a result of recent import barriers including the forthcoming European ‘common market’, several departments of the Company have increased their activity with regard to certain aspects of their foreign operations, particularly as regards new foreign plant investments. Accordingly, consideration of the implementation of a profit sanctuary company is particularly timely. A profit sanctuary company might currently be used by du Pont (1) to hold stock in du Pont foreign subsidiaries, (2) to grant license agreements under du Pont foreign patents and/or sell du Pont know-how, and (3) to sell du Pont products in foreign markets. In addition to tax savings, it might be desirable to utilize a company in Europe (1) as a sales service and technical assistance center, (2) for direct selling operations in place of independent agents and distributors, or (3) to carry on warehouse operations. All of these activities presently involve du Pont in complicated tax considerations which might better be resolved by a European company. However, the primary and possibly only purpose of a purely profit sanctuary company is to be able to invest U. S. tax dollars in permanent foreign investment.\n* * *\n \nIt is our opinion, that a profit sanctuary trading company (hereinafter referred to as ‘PST company’) or companies formed to sell du Pont products in foreign markets could be organized tax-free. Setting up a ‘PST company’ would involve some internal reorganization since it would be necessary to be able to show that the ‘PST company’ (or its subsidiary) is actually performing the selling function as a separate entity from du Pont. If, in addition to the bare selling function, other responsibilities such as sales service and technical assistance were assigned to the ‘PST company’, its recognition as a separate entity for tax purposes should be assured.\n \n* * *\n \nAllocation of selling profit to the ‘PST company’ might require modification of the method of presenting operating statistics in order to avoid depriving the operating departments of a portion of their export sales profits.\n \n* * *\n \nBased on actual 1957 export sales (and profits) to European countries including the United Kingdom, it is estimated, as disclosed by the following tabulation, that by operating through a Swiss (Geneva) trading company, additional funds available for investment would have ranged from $.8MM to $2.3MM depending on the selling price of du Pont to the Geneva trading company.\n \n \n\n\n\n\n% of Pre-tax Earnings on European Export Sales to Swiss (Geneva) Trading Company\n \n|Estimated Annual Savings\n \n|\n75%\n \n|$2.3MM\n \n|\n50%\n \n|1.5MM\n \n|\n25%\n \n|.8MM\n \n|\n\n\n\n\n*44 The highest amount is based on a selling price of mill cost plus 10%. The intermediate amount is based on a selling price designed to distribute the profits equally between du Pont and the Geneva trading company. The lowest amount is based on a selling price which would allow du Pont around half of its present average return on its operating investment with an equal distribution of the remaining profits between du Pont and the Geneva trading company.\n* * *\n \nAs indicated above, the advantages which might be realized through a ‘PST company’ depend largely upon the amount of profits which might be shifted (through selling price) from du Pont to the ‘PST company’. Popular articles on the general subject of profit sanctuaries always point out the danger that the form of organizations may be disregarded or that an allocation of income back to the U. S. parent might be made by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue. The Internal Revenue Code provides that where two or more organizations are owned by the same interest, the Government may allocate gross income, deductions, credits or allowances between or among them if the Commissioner of Internal Revenue determines that this is necessary in order to prevent evasion of taxes or clearly to reflect the income of such organizations. There has been very little application of this principle to situations involving foreign corporations. We have been unable to find any instances where the Internal Revenue Service has attempted to either disregard the corporate entities or to reallocate income of a profit sanctuary company to its American parent.\n \nIn any event, we are convinced that we could arrive at a selling price sufficiently low as to result in the transfer of a substantial part of the profits on export sales to the ‘PST company’, and that if du Pont is to expand its investments in foreign countries, serious consideration should be given to the formation of one or more ‘PST companies’.\n \n \n43. In fact, as to the tax, financial and legal implications of a tax haven subsidiary for the conduct of overseas business, the task force proposed by the International Department’s March 1958 memorandum had been functioning in a lossely organized manner since the fall of 1957. Its principal members were Dr. De Right, assistant director of the International Department (prior to the name change he occupied the same position with the Foreign Relations Department), Messrs. Roy Wentz and Daniel F. O’Connor of the Legal Department, and Mr. Eldon M. Robinson of the Treasurer’s Department. The main concerns of the International Department in this undertaking were with the formulation of an organizational structure that would be most appropriate to the accomplishment of plaintiff’s overall objectives in conducting its business in the Common Market trading area. In that regard the department’s chief aim was to secure the support of the general managers of plaintiff’s major industrial departments for the concept of establishing a central selling agency in Europe to service the Common Market area. The problem, of course, was that this approach seemingly called for the surrender of at least some of the managerial autonomy traditionally enjoyed by the general managers in the manufacture and distribution of the product line of their respective departments. That problem was surmounted in the manner hereinafter indicated. The concern of the Treasurer’s Department, on the other hand, was with the tax and financial aspects of the style in which plaintiff was to conduct its European business. In plaintiff’s organization the Treasurer’s Department not only has primary responsibility for financial matters in general but for tax administration as well. In the tax area the Legal Department functions as counsel to the Treasurer’s Department. Neither Mr. Wentz nor Mr. O’Connor were called to tetify in this proceeding. Mr. Robinson, who functioned as chief representative on the task force of the Treasurer’s Department, testified extensively as a witness for the plaintiff and proved to be both thoroughly knowledgeable and completely credible. Because the undisputed evidence shows that Mr. Robinson was the person most directly and centrally involved in shaping the decisions reached on all tax aspects of the proposed European venture and because he was the person solely responsible for conceiving the transfer price that was used for sales of merchandise from plaintiff to DISA, all of the tax-oriented factual attributes of DISA, as hereinafter set forth, are, with a single exception, either based on or supported by his testimony; the exception being his asserted belief that plaintiff regarded its export business as being of marginal profitability and conducted it accordingly. See finding 77, infra.\n \n*45 44. From the outset, Mr. Robinson understood that an important function of the planned European sales subsidiary was the generation of capital funds to be used for the establishment of production facilities in the Common Market—facilities that he further understood were in management’s view absolutely essential to plaintiff’s successful participation in that market.\n \n45. In late 1957, at the instance of Mr. Wentz, plaintiff retained the services of Russell Baker, Esquire, a reputed expert on the formation of overseas tax haven subsidiaries by United States corporations, for the purpose of securing counseling and assistance on the means by which plaintiff might form such a subsidiary for the conduct of its overseas business and on the feasibility of its doing so. Mr. Robinson consulted with Mr. Baker on this subject several times and also contacted some of the corporations that had established tax haven subsidiaries under Mr. Baker’s guidance. Mr. Robinson found that the tax haven subsidiary of one of such corporations, headquartered in Chicago, was little more than a ‘paper’ operation in which the essence of the selling function was altogether performed by the domestic parent with the only activity occurring overseas being the passage of title to the goods involved. In those circumstances, Mr. Baker told Mr. Robinson that the bulk of overall profits on the merchandise sold were allocated to the tax haven subsidiary and that the Internal Revenue Service had accepted that treatment. Mr. Robinson did not pursue that inquiry further because plaintiff was intending to transfer the selling function abroad and was not interested in creating merely a ‘paper’ operation.\n \n46. Plaintiff received an advisory opinion dated May 23, 1958, from Mr. Baker in which he strongly recommended that it form a tax haven subsidiary. The opinion concluded with the following recommendations:\n1. That a base company be formed in Switzerland as a wholly owned subsidiary of E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Company.\n \n2. That the stock of all foreign subsidiaries formed hereafter be held by the base company.\n \n3. That the base company function as the (a) holding company, (b) trader, (c) banker, (d) merchandiser of intangibles, and (e) manager, controller, and coordinator of the Du Pont family (i. e., the international family).\n \n4. That the parent, E. I. du Pont de Nemours Company, confine its activities to the domestic scene and thus insulate its domestic assets from foreign risks.\n \n5. That the base company be formed before the Belgian paint company is brought into being so as to avoid complications incident to a subsequent transfer.\n \n6. That for the long range, the assets of the wholly owned foreign subsidiaries be sold to the base company and the foreign subsidiary be liquidated upstream to the end that the base company relieve the parent of its present holding company position.\n \nIt is often asserted that a base company operation is more expensive than the laissez-faire pattern. This is a generalization and, like most such, is not accurate. Experience shows that there should be no extra cost in operating a base company once the transaction is made. In fact, the opportunity to re-examine existing procedures critically in itself is valuable in the light of a practical alternative.\n \n \n*46 47. As reflected by a file memorandum prepared on June 10, 1958, by Mr. H. W. Samworth, an assistant to Mr. Robinson in the comptroller’s office, Messrs. Robinson, Wentz and Samworth visited Mr. Baker on June 4, 1958, at his Chicago law firm to reconcile what plaintiff’s people perceived to be certain discrepancies in information that they had gathered from various sources concerning the relative impact of Swiss, Belgian and Netherlands income tax provisions on the European business that plaintiff proposed to conduct. The memorandum records that Mr. Baker reaffirmed the view expressed in his earlier advisory opinion to the effect that from a tax standpoint, as well as otherwise, Switzerland was the preferred location for the profit sanctuary company under consideration by plaintiff.\n \n48. On June 20, 1958, Messrs. Robinson and Samworth circulated to members of various staff and industrial departments for comment a draft of a proposed memorandum entitled PROFIT SANCTUARY COMPANIES to be submitted to the Executive Committee by the International and Treasurer’s Departments. The memorandum explained its objective as follows:\nThe purpose of this report is to outline tentative conclusions as to how a profit sanctuary company or companies might operate to du Pont’s advantage, possible location thereof, activities which might be assigned to them, etc., in order that decision might be reached as to the advisability of creating a task force to make a comprehensive study of the use of such companies and to prepare definite recommendations with respect thereto that can be submitted for your consideration.\n \n \nIn keeping with the tenor of earlier memoranda on the same subject, the memorandum noted at the outset that the primary purpose of a profit sanctuary company is to accumulate earnings free of United States tax for reinvestment in foreign areas as opportunities or needs arise. The memorandum then related that of 41 countries having taxing structures amenable to a profit sanctuary operation it appeared that only seven—Bahamas, Bermuda, Canada, Panama, Venezuela, Switzerland, and Lichtenstein—showed sufficient potential suitability for plaintiff’s purposes to warrant serious consideration in its plans for doing business in the Common Market. Of those seven countries the memorandum reported that on the basis of study to date it appeared that Switzerland offered the best location for a profit-sanctuary company to be established by plaintiff. The memorandum concluded with the following observations and proposals:\n \n\n\nPricing Policy\nOne of the major problems encountered in the use of profit sanctuary companies is the pricing policy to be followed with respect to products ‘sold’ by the parent company to the international trading company for resale abroad. This policy, of course, determines the extent to which profits on export sales are ‘allocated’ to the trading company (which performs the selling function) and thus escape U. S. tax and the extent to which such profits are attributable to the parent company (which performs the manufacturing function) and thus remain fully taxable. Unless some sound, supportable intercompany price is established, there is always the danger that the Internal Revenue Service will reallocate such profits to the parent company for U. S. tax purposes and thus at least partially undo what the profit sanctuary arrangement is trying to accomplish.\n*47 At present the general du Pont Company practice governing sales to foreign subsidiaries is to charge a price approximately equal to that charged unrelated distributors for the same goods; however, there are many exceptions. Continuation of this practice in the case of the international trading company would not provide that company with sufficient funds free of U. S. tax to make the venture worthwhile. However, this past precedent may give us trouble opposite the Internal Revenue Service if we are ever called upon to defend some other pricing basis. We should be prepared to prove that the trading company is performing more functions than now being performed by our existing foreign subsidiaries.\n \nThere are few, if any, good guides as to acceptable pricing policies that can be gleaned from the U. S. income tax rulings and regulations or from court decisions in this area; and the literature on profit sanctuaries is very vague on the point. The impression has been gained that most U. S. companies using profit sanctuaries use a standard mark-up over cost. One drug company, we were informed, tests their intercompany price against (a) cost plus a fixed percentage, (b) list price less a fixed percentage, or (c) the price at which the product would be sold to the U. S. Government.\n \nDevelopment of a recommended pricing policy for the du Pont Company that—\n \n(a) will allocate the maximum amount of profit on export sales to the trading company, and\n \n(b) can be sustained opposite the Internal Revenue Service without resorting to litigation\n \nwill be one of the major goals of the task force.\n \nIn order not to deprive the Industrial Departments of the ‘fruits’ of their efforts in this field and to encourage them to give the international trading company the utmost cooperation, the task force will also be asked to work out some method of reallocating the trading company profits back to the respective departments for internal reporting and E. C. Chart purposes.\n \n \n\n\nDissolution\nIncome accumulated by the profit sanctuary company and any appreciation or growth in its assets can be transferred to the parent company upon dissolution at a U. S. tax rate no higher than the 25% rate applicable to long-term capital gains.\n \n\n\nTask Force\nThe importance of the problem and the magnitude of the potential benefits to the du Pont Company* seem to require an intensive study of profit sanctuary arrangements as promptly as possible. Unless your Committee objects, we propose to organize a task force for this purpose composed of representatives from International, Legal, Treasurer’s and one of the Industrial Departments. We would expect to employ outside counsel with wide experience in these matters to assist the task force as required.\n \n*48 The specific objectives of the task force would include:\n(a) Definite recommendation as to whether du Pont Company should proceed to organize one or more profit sanctuary companies.\n \n(b) The number of such companies and the location thereof.\n \n(c) The functions to be performed by the profit sanctuary companies and the impact of this on existing Industrial Department export sales units.\n \n(d) Procedures and methods to be employed in conducting export sales through the profit sanctuary companies.\n \n(e) Pricing policy to be adopted on intercompany transfers.\n \n(f) Organization and staffing of profit sanctuary companies.\n \n(g) Advantages, if any, of having a profit sanctuary company hold ownership of existing or newly-formed foreign manufacturing subsidiaries.\n \nIt is expected that the study will require between six months and a year to complete and that the out-of-pocket expense (principally for travel and outside counsel) will not exceed $50,000, which will be absorbed by the departments involved in their regular accounts.\n \n \n49. Among the persons to whom the joint memorandum described in the preceding finding was directed for comment was J. Preston Wills, director of export sales for the Organic Chemicals Department. Mr. Wills responded by a memorandum of June 23, 1958, in which his principal suggestions related to rewording that he believed would tone down the prominence of tax considerations among the reasons for establishing a European sales subsidiary. Thus, he observed: ‘Most of my comments are based upon the very frequent use of the words ‘profit sanctuary’ which have been used 26 times.’ For example, he proposed: ‘If possible, I would suggest a different title such as OVERSEAS TRADING COMPANIES or if the words PROFIT SANCTUARY must be used, then let it be in the title only and not repeated as many times as it has been in the draft which would seem to indicate that our only interest in operating through an overseas holding or trading company is the avoidance of taxes.’ Subsequent memoranda dealing with the same subject reflect that, while whereas the subject remained basically unchanged, the admonitions of Mr. Wills as to the language employed were heeded. While the evidence does not specifically so reflect, it is clear from subsequent events that the proposal for intensive task force study of profit sanctuary possibilities was not disapproved by the Executive Committee.\n \n50. In mid-July 1958, at approximately the time that Mr. Carpenter became head of the International Department, a task force composed of Messrs. Robinson, Wentz and O’Connor made a fact-finding trip to Europe. They were joined there by Mr. Russell Nelson, a man of considerable familiarity with European markets and with the network of distributors that plaintiff had in those markets. In 1956 Mr. Nelson had become assistant European manager of plaintiff’s London office, having been attached to plaintiff’s Basel, Switzerland, office since 1949, first as a technical representative working with European distributors of plaintiff’s dyestuffs and textile chemicals and later as manager of the Basel office.\n \n*49 The principal stops on the itinerary were Switzerland, Belgium and Holland. Mr. Robinson, who headed the task force, explained that the principal objectives of the trip were (1) to secure an advance understanding with Swiss authorities on the effective tax rate to which profits earned by a Swiss selling subsidiary on sales outside of Switzerland would be subject, (2) to explore the same question with Belgian authorities in the event that plaintiff were to either locate such a subsidiary in Belgium or establish there a sales branch of a Swiss subsidiary, and (3) to determine as between Belgium and Holland, which of those countries would grant the more favorable tax treatment to profits earned on overseas sales of Orlon to be manufactured within their respective boundaries. In addition, Mr. Robinson consulted with banking interests in each of those countries concerning the currency exchange control aspects of conducting the same type operations in each of those countries. It appears that Mr. O’Connor gathered information from government authorities and private counsel concerning the corporate law aspects of incorporation in the three countries for the purposes in which plaintiff was interested.\n \n51. In a memorandum of July 30, 1958, Messrs. Robinson, Wentz and O’Connor recorded the results of their visits to Switzerland and Belgium. In essence, they reported that Switzerland’s combined federal and cantonal tax rate on profits from sales made outside Switzerland was projected to be approximately 9 percent, this as contrasted with a Belgian rate of approximately 28 percent. Further, the Belgian authorities indicated that the same rate would apply to profits of a Belgian manufacturing subsidiary and they declined to commit themselves for more than a 2-year trial period as to the measure of profits to which the 28 percent rate would be applied in the case of either a manufacturing or sales subsidiary. Finally, it was reported that Swiss taxes on employee compensation were considerably lighter than those imposed by Belgium.\n \n52. Under date of July 31, 1958, Mr. J. K. Jenney, assistant general manager of the International Department directed the following self-explanatory letter to the persons indicated:\nH. J. HAON (R. C. NELSON)—EUROPEAN OFFICE\n \nD. H. CONKLIN (W. D. EATON)—DU PONT-U. K.\n \nA. H. GEIL—TEXTILE FIBERS DEPARTMENT\n \nL. R. ECKMAN—ELASTOMERS DEPARTMENT\n \nRALPH PLOWMAN (H. A. MEDEIROS)—F. & F.\n \nL. B. DENNETT—TEXTILE FIBERS\n \n \n\n\nCOMMERCIAL OPERATION AND PERSONNEL REQUIREMENTS OF A PROPOSED SWISS SELLING AND INVESTMENT COMPANY\nAttached herewith is a rough outline of preliminary ideas on the functions and structure of a proposed Swiss company to handle the sale of certain du Pont products in Europe.\nIt is desired to develop from this an outline of the detailed procedures and personnel requirements to operate such a company, including a checklist of all questions that need investigation.\n \nWe desire to move forward to the preparation of a report to the Executive Committee promptly and would therefore appreciate your very prompt comments.\n \n*50 The six-page attachment described the initial functions of the Swiss company as follows:\n \n1. To organize and hold du Pont investment in Belgian Subsidiary Company. (Management of that company will be under an independent board of directors—see later). At a later date, it might make additional investments either in existing or new du Pont subsidiaries.\n \n2. Conduct sales of ‘Orlon’, neoprene and possibly Finishes in Europe and certain other countries (to be established in consultation with Export Divisions).\n \nUpon establishment of manufacture of above products in Belgium and North Ireland, the Geneva company will handle sales outside of the respective home markets—i. e. U. K. for neoprene; Belgium for ‘Orlon’ and Finishes.\n \nCoordination of sales of the above products as between European and U. S. sources requires coordination which can best be supplied by handling the products thru a common distributing organization which should be under the general direction of the Parent Company. This organization while utilizing the present distributors should be directed by du Pont personnel located in Europe directing the activities of the distributors and supply technical and merchandising service.\n \n \nThe attachment then indicated that the Swiss company was to be based in Geneva and invited suggestions as to the commercial and financial considerations that would support that location.\n \nAs to the contemplated basis on which goods transferred to the Swiss company would be priced, the attachment stated:\nTransfers from Parent Company: Goods will be sold by the Parent Company to the Geneva company on a basis providing the Geneva company with a substantial sales profit to permit the Geneva company to accumulate funds for Working Capital requirements and for Investments. (This includes goods sold to Belgium).\n \nBasis of such transfers (Treasurer’s Department and Wentz).\n \nChart treatment of earnings—how can the Investments of the Industrial Departments supplying the goods be credited with earnings? (Treasurer’s Department should recommend).\n \nTransfers from U. K. and Belgian Companies—same questions\n \nIn the case of U. K., what are requirements of British tax and foreign exchange regulations re pricing of goods transferred to the Geneva company. (Eaton should give his opinion promptly).\n \nSame questions re Belgian company (Treasurer’s Department and Wentz).\n \n \n53. The evidence shows that one of the addressees of the Jenney letter, Mr. Haon of plaintiff’s London office was in Wilmington at the time that the Jenney letter was prepared and personally discussed its subject matter and that of its attachment with Mr. Jenney. By July 31, 1958, Mr. Haon had returned to his London post and on that date wrote Mr. Jenney as follows:\nThe chief question you raised with me in Wilmington on July 28 and discussed with Mr. Nelson and myself by telephone on July 29 was that of the location of headquarters of the chief selling organization of Du Pont International S. A. It seems obvious that there are only three locations for sales headquarters to be considered. These are Belgium, Holland, or some location in Switzerland, with Geneva apparently the most likely Swiss location. This does not rule out the possibility of setting up smaller branch offices of Du Pont International S. A. in Germany, Italy, Scandinavia, France, or elsewhere, if, as and when justified.\n \n*51 I understood from Mr. O’Connor on July 29 that as between Belgium, Holland and Switzerland, there is no question but that Geneva, Switzerland, is the preferred location from the viewpoint of favorable tax treatment and legal considerations. This coincides with everything we have heard from outside sources during the past several years. It has been confirmed to me by Mr. Nelson’s statements and reports of the recent conversations with the authorities in Belgium, Holland and Switzerland. From Mr. Nelson’s statements to me I concluded that the advantages of locating the principal sales organization of Du Pont International S. A. in Switzerland over Belgium to be:\n \n(1) This Swiss (Geneva) tax law on profits made from sales outside of Switzerland provides a long-term low rate of about 9%.\n \n(2) In contrast, the Belgian Government, while willing to set a temporary low tax rate on profits made by a branch office of Du Pont International S. A., refuse to assure us what tax treatment will be expected after the first two-year period.\n \n(3) The Swiss (Geneva) tax on personal income is such that it will not be necessary to ‘gross up’ salaries of resident American personnel who for many years can be expected to be an important part of the resident sales organization. Their income taxes in Switzerland will be approximately comparable with U. S. taxes. In the higher income tax brackets the Swiss tax will be considerably less than American tax on comparable incomes (precise data on this is being developed).\n \n(4) In Belgium, because of ‘grossing up’ on salaries of American employees of the branch office, the personal income tax burden would be a very heavy item of expense.\n \nIt seems to me that the foregoing are dominating reasons why the sales organization should be set up in Geneva. [Emphasis added.]\n \n* * *\n \nTo sum up, we thing that it is likely the headquarters sales organization in Europe will involve a good many Americans for quite some years to come. In fact, we believe that it will be possible to staff Du Pont (UK). Societe E. I. du Pont de Nemours (Belgium) S. A. with local nationals and Americans replaced by nationals much sooner than will be possible with the centralized sales organization of Du Pont International S. A. We believe that the management problem of attracting Americans and their families to work and live in Europe will be easier in the case of Geneva than it would be in the case of Belgium or Holland, and that American personnel and their families will be happier in the Geneva location. While it is a fact that Brussels is more centrally located than Geneva, geographically and in relation to the population of European markets of interest to us, we do not consider that there is a significant disadvantage here in relation to the very real advantages of Switzerland as to corporate and personal taxes which dominate in favor of Geneva. [Emphasis added.]\n \nA final thought is that in time we believe it will be logical for Du Pont International S. A. to own and operate a research establishment in Switzerland which will use lightly taxed earnings of Du Pont International S. A. to support the research work. You will recall that findings of the studies by our department and Central Research pointed to Geneva, Switzerland, as the likely location for such a research establishment without basing this conclusion on the idea of using lightly taxed du Pont profits.\n \n*52 Thus, our scientists’ concept of the best location for such a research establishment coincides with the location which appears to be best as a headquarters for du Pont’s commercial operations in Europe. This helps in an overall sense to point to Geneva as an attractive, important location for new du Pont activities to be centralized long range. The same favorable personal income tax advantages which exist for sales personnel would be applicable to scientific or technical personnel who might temporarily be employed in the research laboratory.\n \n \n54. By a letter of August 13, 1958, Mr. D. H. Conklin, managing director of Du Pont (UK), responded to Mr. Jenney’s inquiry letter of July 31, 1958, set forth in finding 51, supra. Referring to the pricing portions of the proposal on which Mr. Jenney had solicited comment, Mr. Conklin, after noting that as to the tax aspects he was appending the comments of Mr. Eaton, Du Pont’s (UK) director of finance, observed:\nEven if the Inland Revenue problems are resolved, we have one more question on pricing which concerns us. Approximately half of the Maydown production is destined for Europe and the other half in the Sterling market. If the European half is taken at a fictitious price, the other half must bear the brunt of earning a return on our investment. This will either be very low or the Sterling price of neoprene will have to be raised. [Emphasis added.]\n \n \nConcerning the extent to which the United Kingdom taxing authorities would permit plaintiff to attribute profits to the Swiss sales company on the transfer to it of goods manufactured by Du Pont (UK), Mr. Eaton commented as follows:\nIn the U. K. we run into just about the same thing that exists in the U. S. Any sales to the Geneva Company would have to be on an ‘arms length’ basis (See copy of Section 469 attached). Being able to point to a price to other ‘selling companies’ would be a good starting point. In the final analysis, we would, if ever challenged by Inland Revenue, have to be able to convincingly balance the profit being passed to the Geneva Company against the contribution of that Company to our sales results, keeping in mind that present distributors in Europe would handle the ‘final’ sale of our products. In other words, the profit that would remain with the Geneva Company would be judged on the degree of contribution of that company. It is true that Inland Revenue is inclined to accept a 50–50 split in profit between manufacturing and selling if it is merely a matter of arriving at a figure and the facts support something in that range. [Emphasis added.]\n \nWe also considered the exposure to Section 468 (see copy attached) and believe that if the Geneva Company is in operation before Du Pont U. K. actually makes sales on the Continent, we would not be in the position of transferring part of our trade to a non-resident and hence would not need to get prior Treasury approval.\n \n \n55. Mr. Eldon Robinson testified that more favorable tax treatment of profits was the prime factor that caused plaintiff to locate DISA in Switzerland rather than Belgium.\n \n*53 56. It had been recognized from the outset that the support of the industrial departments’ general managers was crucial to the success of a Swiss sales subsidiary. See findings 37, 42 and 43, supra.\n \n57. By a letter of September 3, 1958, the International Department’s Mr. Carpenter invited comment by the general managers of the Textile Fibers, Elastomer Chemicals, Fabrics and Finishes, Electrochemicals and Grasselli Chemicals Departments on an accompanying draft of a six-page International Department memorandum to the Executive Committee entitled ORGANIZATION FOR EUROPEAN BUSINESS. The draft memorandum outlined the respective functions and responsibilities of the proposed Swiss Company and the International Department as follows:\nDu Pont Swiss will be generally responsible for all du Pont Company activities in Europe. It can be both a holding and operating company, owning du Pont U. K., du Pont de Nemours (Belge) S. A., and other future European subsidiaries, or in the absence of direct ownership could manage the subsidiaries through Management contracts. Du Pont Swiss will be run by a Managing Director (who would report directly to the General management of the International Department) assisted by a Management Committee** comprising members of management from du Pont Swiss, the European subsidiaries, Industrial Departments having a substantial interest, and the International Department. Within the framework of the Management Committee, the Managing Director of each subsidiary will be responsible for his company’s return on investment and will have a controlling voice in sales policies for product lines handled by his company. Liaison and supervision of all European investments by the International Department will be exercised through the Swiss Company.\n \n* * *\n \nDu Pont Swiss, operated according to the foregoing outline, will actually be a ‘base company’ or tax sanctuary on a small scale. As of now, for example, in the absence of a suitable base company, profits on du Pont U. K. export sales, forecast to be half of production, will be entirely subject to U. K. income tax. However, if du Pont Swiss performs the export sales function, part of the profit would be subject only to the Swiss tax, which is less than a quarter of the U. K. tax. The benefits accruing from this type operation can be expanded through increasing the amount of du Pont export sales channeled through du Pont Swiss as experience and conditions dictate. On the other hand, if, as a result of studies now under way, it should develop that the Company’s long-term interests could be served best by the establishment in the relatively near future of a base company in a different country, the functions of Du Pont Swiss could be transferred in part or in whole to such new base company without adverse tax consequences.\n \n* * *\n \nThe International Department is the third component of the proposed structure. In its newly assigned designation as an Industrial Department, the Department’s operating responsibilities are certain to become greater than in the past, while at the same time its responsibilities auxiliary to other departments will become relatively less important. General Managers of the domestic Industrial Departments will be freed from line responsibility for European subsidiaries; and for the first time in any foreign area, there will be unified direction of the Company’s interests.\n \n*54 In order effectively to meet its new and broadened responsibilities, the International Department has to be realigned and staffed with qualified individuals who will maintain proper coordination between (a) the manufacturing subsidiaries and the Industrial Departments whose skills are being utilized; (b) between the manufacturing subsidiaries and du Pont Swiss which will market the subsidiaries’ exports as above outlined; and (c) between the subsidiaries and the parent company in respect to corporate financial, legal, and personnel matters.\n \nThe draft proposal concluded as follows:\n \nThis proposal has been reviewed by the General Managers of the Textile Fibers, Grasselli Chemicals, Elastomer Chemicals, Fabrics & Finishes, and Electrochemicals Departments as well as the Treasurer, the Development and Legal Departments. Their conclusions can be summarized as follows:\n1. From the standpoint of any one Industrial Department the proposed organization is workable although the advantages, purely from a product sales standpoint, are not significant.\n \n2. There is general agreement that the several companies operating in Europe will benefit from unified direction.\n \n3. Export sales can similarly benefit from unified coordination in Europe, particularly if substantially all major product lines sold in volume in Europe are handled by the Swiss Company.\n \n4. They can see the operating advantages to the International Department and the tax advantages to the du Pont Company.\n \n \nOther Industrial Departments have not yet been consulted.\nApproval in principle of the above-outlined form of European organization is requested.\n \n \n58. The vast preponderance of product proposed to be routed through the Swiss selling company originated with the Textile Fibers and Elastomer Chemicals Departments. Accordingly, it was on those departments that the creation of the Swiss company would impact most heavily. Neither viewed the prospect with any general enthusiasm but both agreed to tolerate it for reasons of potential tax savings.\n \n59. By a memorandum of September 3, 1958, the general manager of the Textile Fibers Department responded to Mr. Carpenter as follows:\n \n\nComments on Draft 9/3/58\n\n‘ORGANIZATION FOR EUROPEAN BUSINESS’\nRecognizing that tax considerations will command the establishment of lowest practical transfer prices from the manufacturing subsidiaries to du Pont Swiss, we wish to emphasize the necessity for controlling selling prices abroad so that they do not jeopardize the domestic price structure. We have found it necessary to set a minimum selling price for our European agents in order to avoid a glaring disparity between realized selling prices here and abroad. With off-list selling by our European competitors, this policy costs us some sales in Europe, but this is preferable to the demoralization of the domestic price structure. We feel that we must be in position to exercise the same sort of control over the pricing policy of our own organization in du Pont Swiss.\n*55 The last sentence on page 4 is meaningless to me since I have never been burdened with any line responsibility to be ‘freed’ from and since it seems to me that ‘Ducilo’, for instance, has had ‘unified direction of the Company’s interests.’\n \nWith respect to the functions of International Department, page 5, I think it would be highly desirable to establish free lines of communication between the Managing Director of a subsidiary and the domestic Department to minimize the need for ‘co-ordinators’ and to nurture the continuing ‘partnership’ interest of the domestic Department. This should not only minimize overhead but speed up the transaction of business. Nor can I recognize any need for co-ordination between the subsidiary and du Pont Swiss, since the Managing Director is controlling sales policy for his products and is sitting on the Managing Committee of du Pont Swiss. Co-ordinators butter very few parships.\n \nIndented paragraph 3 at bottom of page 5: Suggest omitting it, because, as I understand it I don’t entirely subscribe to it. If it refers to tax ‘benefit’, it is covered by 4. In any event, it is not a persuasive point.\n \n \n60. By a memorandum of September 4, 1958, the general manager of the Elastomer Chemicals Department, who was later to become plaintiff’s president and still later its board chairman, forwarded the following comments to Mr. Carpenter:\n \n\n\nORGANIZATION FOR EUROPEAN BUSINESS\nThe summary of conclusions represents our point of view somewhat more strongly than we had intended. The decisive factor in our support of the organization is the potential tax saving. If this is substantial, it could more than compensate for the loss in efficiency inherent in the organization.\nWe believe the following statement should be included in the write-up: ‘Final authority over product selling price and sales policies, whether the product is sold by the Swiss company or a subsidiary, will remain with the industrial departments.’\n \n \n61. Under date of September 19, 1958, the International Department forwarded to the Executive Committee a materially shortened version of the September 3 draft memorandum; this time emphasizing the important role of European manufacturing subsidiaries, and postulating essentially advisory functions for both the European sales subsidiary and the International Department, vis-a-vis, the affected industrial departments. On September 26, 1958, the Executive Committee noted its general approval of the International Department’s proposal and its desire for a further report on the same subject from the same source.\n \n62. Throughout the summer and fall of 1958, representatives of the International, Treasurer’s and Legal Departments continued work on the amplification and refinement of the Treasurer’s Department’s November 1957 memorandum to the Executive Committee dealing with the potential benefits to plaintiff of a profit sanctuary. Finding 39, supra. The record includes two draft versions of a proposed joint memorandum to the Executive Committee from the International and Treasurer’s Departments; one dated September 22, 1958 and another dated October 3, 1958. Each of those drafts were edited and on October 3, 1958, the two departments submitted a 34-page memorandum, entitled PROFIT SANCTUARY COMPANY, to the Executive Committee. In emphasis and general content, the memorandum was a greatly expanded edition of the Treasurer’s original memorandum of November 1957. Included in it were the following noteworthy statements:\n*56 For purposes of this discussion, a profit sanctuary company may be defined as a company, usually wholly-owned by its U. S. parent, established in a ‘base’ country which imposes relatively low income or capital taxes, or no taxes at all, on income from sources outside the base country realized by corporations domiciled therein. The primary objective of such a company usually is to accumulate earnings abroad (i.e., outside the U. S.) for investment in foreign areas as opportunities or needs arise. The accumulation of earnings abroad is principally accomplished by having the profit sanctuary company handle export sales of the parent company and its foreign manufacturing subsidiaries. Since the earnings of the profit sanctuary company are not subject to U. S. tax (until the earnings are paid to the parent company), the amount of funds that can be thus accumulated for foreign investment purposes is significantly greater than would be the case if the earnings were realized directly by the U. S. parent and thus taxes at the high U. S. rate. [Emphasis added.]\n \n* * *\n \nThe additional funds made available for investment abroad through use of a profit sanctuary company might be viewed as representing ‘deferred’ U. S. taxes that would otherwise be due on profits from export sales if such profits were all earned directly by the du Pont Company or if the profit sanctuary company remitted all its earnings to the U. S. as dividends. Therefore, such additional funds may be likened to an ‘interest-free loan’ from the U. S. Government with no fixed maturity date. The deferred tax will not become due and payable unless and until the foreign investment in which the funds were utilized is liquidated and the proceeds repatriated. In most cases where the funds are invested in manufacturing enterprises, for all practical purposes, the ‘loan’ will be permanent. The U. S. Government will, of course, receive its proportionate share of tax (net of foreign tax credit) on any earnings generated from the new foreign investment that flow to the United States as dividends. [Emphasis added.]\n \n* * *\n \nThe channeling of Du Pont (US) export sales through a profit sanctuary company appears to provide the only practical method of accumulating a significant amount of funds abroad in the immediate future.\n \n \nThe memorandum also contained the following remarks dealing with the necessity of attracting and retaining the support of the various industrial departments:\nIn order not to deprive the industrial departments of the ‘fruits’ of their efforts with respect to foreign business because of the modest mark-up at which the products will be sold to the profit sanctuary company and to encourage the departments to give that company the utmost cooperation, some practical method should be devised to reflect the earning power of the profit sanctuary company in the statistics of the respective departments for internal reporting and E. C. chart purposes. [Emphasis added.]\n \n \n*57 In the September 22, 1958 draft of the same memorandum the underscored portion of the above quote read ‘because of the ‘artificially’ low price.’ That language, authored by Mr. Robinson, the man who determined the transfer prices to be used, was eliminated in favor of that used in the final version. The evidence shows, as will be hereafter demonstrated, that Mr. Robinson’s original language was exactly descriptive of the character of the prices at which goods were transferred from plaintiff to DISA.\n \nThe joint memorandum concluded as follows:\nConclusions reached as a result of our study to date may be summarized as follows:\n \n(1) The use of a profit sanctuary company to handle export sales of Du Pont (US) and its foreign manufacturing subsidiaries is feasible and, if we expect to have substantial attractive foreign investment opportunities, could result in positive and significant financial advantages for the Company and its stockholders.\n \n(2) Sales of neoprene and other Elastomer products, ‘Orlon’ and other Textile Fibers products, and, perhaps, finishes in the European area provide a logical starting point for operation of the profit sanctuary company since responsibility for European sales of these products is expected to be transferred to European subsidiaries in the near future. Other product lines can be added as experience dictates.\n \n(3) Switzerland is the preferred location for a profit sanctuary company handling export sales in the European area.\n \nIf your Committee has no objection in principle to conducting export sales in whole or in part through a profit sanctuary company, our studies will be continued and recommendation as to the formation of a company, its organizational structure, methods of selling, etc., will be submitted promptly upon completion of the studies including those to be conducted by the European Director.\n \n \n63. On October 22, 1958, the Executive Committee registered its lack of objection ‘in principle to the organization and utilization of an European subsidiary to handle Du Pont Company’s export sales (a) from the United States and (b) from European manufacturing subsidiaries, provided such action is indicated as the most effective course to maximize sales and profit potential.’\n \n64. On October 31, 1958, Mr. Daniel O’Connor, of the Legal Department reported to the senior officials of the Textile Fibers, International Treasurer’s Departments the details of what he characterized as ‘* * * the favorable tax arrangement we have recently negotiated with the Netherlands government with respect to allocating taxable profits between a Dutch manufacturing company and a Swiss trading company.’\n \n65. On November 21, 1958, the International Department submitted to the Executive Committee a request for an additional appropriation of $3,600,000 for procurement of long delivery items to be used in the construction of an Orlon plant to be located in Holland rather than Belgium, as originally planned. On July 21, 1958, the Executive Committee had approved an initial appropriation request of $1,450,000 by the International Department for design and cost estimation on an Orlon plant to be built in Belgium. The extensive statement supporting the November appropriation request emphasized the tax considerations that made the establishment of a Swiss selling agency an essential ingredient of the desirability of establishing the proposed facility in Holland. The statement explained:\n*58 Since Part 1 of this project was presented, additional investigation and study has been carried out here and in Europe by representatives of the Engineering. International, Legal, Textile Fibers and Treasurer’s Departments. The results of the preliminary work leading to Part 1 were, in general, confirmed. Additional plant site investigations uncovered a Netherlands site judged better than the best one found in Belgium. Furthermore, if sales outside the home country are handled through a selling company located in a ‘low-tax’ country, the tax situation also favors the location in Netherlands rather than in Belgium.\n \nThus, inherent in the proposal to proceed with the ‘Orlon’ investment at Dordrecht is the establishment of a subsidiary selling company outside of Holland under an arrangement whereby a substantial portion of the earnings from ‘Orlon’ sales in countries other than Holland (93% of total ‘Orlon’ sales) will be taxed at rates lower than the 47% Dutch rate. Switzerland is considered the logical location for this selling company.\n \nFormation at this time of the Swiss sales subsidiary, which initially would have as its sole purpose the distribution of ‘Orlon’, will permit the immediate implementation of our program for establishing an ‘Orlon’ sales organization in Europe to sell ‘Orlon’ from our U. S. plants until the Netherlands plant can supply the demand.\n \nA favorable tax arrangement has been negotiated with the Netherlands Ministry of Finance. It is agreed that, as to ‘Orlon’ manufactured in Holland and sold to a Swiss sales subsidiary of du Pont for resale outside of Holland, the Dutch company would be taxed on the basis of 5% of manufacturing cost, or 20% of the combined profits of the Dutch company and the Swiss selling company, whichever produces the greater base for taxation for the Netherlands. If project results are realized, this arrangement in effect means that about 20% of the profit on ‘Orlon’ sold outside of Holland will remain with the manufacturing company and about 80% with the Swiss organization. The Dutch government reserves the right to review these arrangements after 15 years. Application of this arrangement is reflected in the financial statistics in this project. In the case where earnings are retained, the effect is large, but in the case where all earnings are paid out as dividends to du Pont, the effect is almost entirely eliminated because of the impact of U. S. taxes.\n \nShould the decision be reached ultimately to proceed with an over-all European selling company as discussed in the International-Treasurer’s Department report of October 17, 1958 this Swiss ‘Orlon’ company could be so used.\n \n \nThe extent to which the after-tax profitability of the overall undertaking was dependent upon the marketing of all Orlon sold for export through a Swiss subsidiary was dramatically illustrated by third-year operative earnings and net return on investment projections appended to the appropriation request. Operative earnings shown for the Dutch manufacturing subsidiary, including revenue from Orlon sold within the Netherlands, were posited as $625,000; that as against $3,120,000 for the Swiss selling subsidiary during the same period. Whereas, based on these profit figures, the Dutch subsidiary would realize a return on investment of only 3.1 per cent, the Dutch and Swiss operations combined would realize a return of 17.2 percent.\n \n*59 Finally, it is worth noting that the appropriation request proposed that the Swiss subsidiary accumulate the profits that it realized from the sales of Orlon and loan the proceeds thereof to the Dutch subsidiary in order that the latter could repay plaintiff’s advances to it. Under that arrangement the Treasurer’s Department projected that the average length of time required for plaintiff to recover its entire cash outlay for the overall project (the Dutch manufacturing and Swiss selling subsidiaries) would be less than 4 years.\n \n66. On November 26, 1958, the Executive Committee took two actions; it approved the $3,600,000 appropriation request for an Orlon plant to be located in either Belgium or Holland and it approved the formation of a Swiss subsidiary to be known as Du Pont de Nemours International S. A. ‘* * * with the understanding that such company is of major importance in providing for the organization of the sales forces required to maximize sale of ‘Orlon’ acrylic fiber in European markets regardless of the choice of location for the proposed European ‘Orlon’ plant.’\n \n67. By a memorandum of December 18, 1958, the International Department requested the Executive Committee to authorize an enlargement of DISA’s product line beyond that (Orlon) approved on November 26, 1958, as noted in the preceding finding. Specifically, approval was requested for DISA to handle all sales in Europe of exports from both the United States and from European manufacturing subsidiaries. A major addition to the DISA line was to be neoprene, the principal product of the Elastomer Chemicals Department. The advisability of this addition was justified in the following terms:\nThe Elastomer Chemicals Department has delegated to Du Pont (U. K.) selling responsibility for that department’s American produced products in the U. K. and on the Continent. Although some advantages will result from availability of auxiliary facilities provided by Du Pont International, because of moves already planned by Du Pont (U. K.) creation of the Swiss selling company is not expected to increase Elastomer sales significantly. An important benefit, however, would be increased net earnings available in Europe should the company be operated as a profit sanctuary for European sales.\n \n \nThe accuracy of the above acknowledgment that tax rather than commercial considerations represented the only substantial justification for routing European sales of Elastomer Chemicals Department products through DISA is verified by that department’s announced position on the matter as previously expressed to the International Department in response to the latter’s inquiry. Finding 60, supra.\n \n68. On December 23, 1958, the Executive Committee resolved to expand the scope of DISA’s operations by authorizing it ‘* * * to handle sales outside the United States of (a) Industrial Department products, and (b) products of manufacturing subsidiaries, subject to the agreement of said departments and subsidiaries.’ The committee further resolved that ‘* * * for the present profits earned by Du Pont de Nemours International, S. A. shall be accumulated in that company to provide capital funds for foreign operations.’\n \n*60 69. In February 1959, DISA was organized as a Swiss corporation with its principal place of business at Geneva. Plaintiff was issued all of its stock for $394,451 paid in cash. In December 1959, plaintiff loaned DISA $1,000,000 on a 4 percent demand note which was repaid in full by March 28, 1960. At December 31, 1960, DISA had no loans outstanding from the plaintiff.\n \n70. On February 1, 1959, plaintiff publicly announced the formation of DISA. In January 1959, plaintiff’s European distributors were advised by letter of that impending development. The standard letter explained the functions and objectives of DISA as follows:\nI am writing to tell you about a new development regarding our European business activities. A public announcement will be made soon concerning the establishment of a new sales company, Du Pont de Nemours International, S. A., to be located in Geneva, Switzerland. This new company is designed to help bring about closer relations between distributor organizations and the Du Pont Company, and to help improve our sales in the European market.\n \nAs you will see from the enclosed press release, the new sales company will coordinate our major export activities in Europe in certain product lines. However, this new Swiss company does not plan to make any overall changes in our present practice of selling our products in Europe through distributors. On the contrary, its objective will be to provide distributors with greater support for their sales efforts through direct assistance in promotion, merchandising, product information, and other sales and technical service programs. Initially, the company will be concerned with the sale of textile fibers and elastomers. Other products will be added later. [Emphasis added.]\n \n \n\nVI. Pricing of Products Sold to DISA\n71. The prices at which plaintiff transferred goods to DISA were formulated by Mr. Eldon Robinson of the Treasurer’s Department. In that formulation he was guided solely by what he believed would be acceptable to the Internal Revenue Service, his objective being to maximize DISA’s profits by having plaintiff transfer products to it at the lowest prices that he believed might withstand challenge by the Internal Revenue Service on audit examination. Acknowledging that: ‘We had intended to use DISA as a capital generating vehicle’, i. e., a source of funds untaxed by the United States to be used for the construction of the European manufacturing facilities that plaintiff regarded as essential to its successful participation in that market, Mr. Robinson candidly conceded that he would have set the transfer prices so low as to shift 99 percent of total profits to DISA if he had felt that such prices would have been acceptable to ‘the tax agents.’\n \n72. The prices at which plaintiff transferred products to DISA were conceived with the recognition that they were of no economic significance to plaintiff’s business. Mr. Robinson testified that by the time that the formation of DISA was formally authorized it was generally agreed and understood within plaintiff’s organization, and specifically by the general managers of the industrial departments, that for all internal purposes, including executive compensation, rate-of-return analyses, budgetary and appropriation determinations, and earnings performance as reported to the Executive Committee, all profits recorded by DISA would be attributed to the respective industrial departments from whence came the products on which such profits were realized. For all of these purposes, then, the separate existence of DISA as a distinct entity to which products had been sold was ignored. In plaintiff’s vernacular it was only with the ‘rolled up price,’ i. e., the price at which DISA sold products to plaintiff’s independent distributors, that the industrial departments were concerned. For example, Mr. L. S. Sinness, assistant general manager of the Textile Fibers Department in 1958 and thereafter that department’s general manager, when asked whether he was familiar with the way in which Orlon manufactured by plaintiff in the United States was priced to DISA, testified: ‘We frankly didn’t pay any attention to that. We were only concerned with the rolled up return on the project.’ When then asked whether he was familiar with how the transfer price to DISA was established he responded: ‘No I am not. It was done by the Treasurer’s Department and International Department.’ This disregard of profitability on intercompany transfers of products to DISA was contrary to plaintiff’s general policy of recognizing each industrial department and each corporate subsidiary as a distinct profit center. As will later appear, that policy applied even to intracompany transfers of goods between departments. See finding 77, infra.\n \n*61 73. Mr. Greenewalt and Mr. Carpenter both testified that industrial department personnel were the persons most competent to place a value on the services that were to be performed by DISA in the marketing of plaintiff’s products in Europe. Both gentlemen assumed that in deriving an appropriate transfer price the Treasurer’s Department had consulted with such personnel and both acknowledged that neither the Legal nor Treasurer’s Departments had within them the competence to place an economic value on the services that were to be rendered by DISA.\n \n74. Mr. Robinson testified that he concluded that there was no way to place a value on the services to be performed by DISA and therefore did not solicit the views of the industrial departments on that matter.\n \n75. A file memorandum of January 23, 1959, recording the proceedings at a meeting on intercompany pricing attended by Mr. Robinson and various other members of the Treasurer’s Department, reflects he advised the group that although Mr. Wentz of the Legal Department advocated the use of a transfer price that would yield DISA more than 75 percent of total manufacturing and selling profits, he had never been able to ascertain the basis for Mr. Wentz’ view. The memorandum further reflects that Mr. Robinson preferred a price thast would yield DISA 75 percent of total profit. It relates that he had applied a 75–25 percent split of profits based on full or book costs to one product and found that the end result was approximately the same as would be obtained by applying a 50–50 split of profits calculated on a marginal or out-of-pocket cost basis. In that connection the memorandum stated:\nEMR [Eldon M. Robinson] stated that he thinks that he has come across some tax backing for a 50%–50% split of profits but that he could not recall where. The source may be Example (2)(ii) under section 1.863–3(b)(2) of U. S. Income Tax Regulations, since EMR was Manager of Tax Section when this part of the regulations was studied due to the export sales issue with respect to full recoupment of available foreign tax credit during the audit of du Pont’s 1951 U. S. income tax return.\n \n \n76. Mr. Robinson identified Example (2)(ii) of section 1.863(b) of the Treasury Regulations under the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 as the sole underpinning for his conclusion that plaintiff could legitimately price its goods to DISA at a level that would yield the latter 50 percent of the total profit on a marginal or out-of-pocket cost basis, that being the essential equivalent of 75 percent of the total profit on a full cost basis.\n \n77. Mr. Robinson conceded that the regulation mentioned in the preceding finding, a regulation dealing with the computation of foreign tax credit by a United States manufacturer selling some of its domestically produced goods overseas through a foreign branch, is legally inapplicable to intercompany pricing such as was to occur between plaintiff and DISA. Examination of the regulation reveals that in the situations to which it does apply it does not indicate or imply approval of an allocation of profits that are calculated on less than a full cost basis. Mr. Robinson testified that since plaintiff’s records were uniformly kept on a full cost basis it was necessary to ‘develop’ the marginal costs that he was utilizing for purposes of applying a 50–50 profit split. He conceded that he preferred expressing the pricing formula in terms of marginal rather than full cost because he felt that the Internal Revenue Service would be more apt to accept transfer prices that were represented as attributing only one-half rather than three-quarters of overall profit to DISA. Mr. Robinson’s explanation of why he regarded the use of a marginal cost approach as appropriate to the apportionment of profits to DISA was the one area of his testimony that was simply not credible. His justification was:\n*62 We thought that within the du Pont Company from time to time they would consider the export business more or less a marginal business on which they would be willing to accept business that was offered at prices lower than list when we had otherwise ideal capacity.\n \nAnd on the strength that export business was thought of somewhat on a marginal basis that it was appropriate to measure the business being done with DISA on a marginal basis rather than the more normal full cost basis.\n \n \nThe record includes a file memorandum prepared on June 18, 1958, by Mr. H. W. Samworth, as associate of Mr. Robinson’s in the Treasurer’s Department and a man who worked extensively with him on the profit sanctuary and intercompany pricing projects. The memorandum states as follows:\nOn June 17, Mr. George P. Hunt of International Department outlined to me the du Pont Company’s policies and practices on sales (or transfer) prices to foreign subsidiary companies.\n \nThe general policy is to sell f. o. b. New York, N. Y., at the same price that applies to outside distributors. The goal is the same price that is charged to domestic distributors. In domestic trade, it is customary to allow freight; terms f. o. b. New York, N. Y., are considered to be a practical equivalent. There are some necessary exceptions to this rule. They are detailed below:\n \n1. There have been occasions in the past when export sales of certain products could be made at premium prices. Our cellophane film sold abroad at a premium for some time. However, when domestic prices were raised, no change was made in the export prices and both prices are now comparable.\n \n2. At times it is necessary to sell in export trade at lower prices than in domestic trade to meet specific competition. Examples are Orchem Department’s sales of certain common line dyes in competition with British and German price cutting practices. Also, Textile Fibers Department has had to meet foreign competitive prices for nylon.\n \n3. There are occasions in which terms of sale have to be lengthened in order to meet competition. In such cases, the subsidiary company usually carries the accounts receivable.\n \n4. Some departments sell in domestic trade directly to their customers, but sell in export trade through distributors. The policy in such cases is that the prices should be raised to cover the necessary distributor’s commission. However, in practice, the commission is often based on domestic prices. As justification for this, it is stated that export selling expense is lower than domestic selling expense because there are fewer salesmen, sales officers, etc.\n \n5. There is an Executive Committee ruling that states that transfers within the Company will ordinarily be made at the prices charged to outside customers. This is largely being applied to sales (transfers) to subsidiary companies overseas.\n \nSales (transfers) to the subsidiary companies for their own consumption are at a transfer price which is the same as sales price to overseas consumers.\n \n \n*63 We have noticed that our subsidiary companies earn commissions on direct shipments by du Pont to foreign customers in their area. It is explained that the foreign subsidiary company usually has the say as to whether to buy the goods for resale or have the goods shipped direct to the customer by the du Pont Company. In the latter case they receive a sales commission from du Pont Company. [Emphasis added.]\n \nThere is nothing in the record to suggest either that Mr. Robinson was unaware of his co-worker’s memorandum or that he was not otherwise aware of the corporate policies recorded in that memorandum. Moreover, uncontroverted evidence shows that in fact, plaintiff’s profit margins were typically as great, and frequently greater, on its export sales than they were on its domestic business. Findings 31 and 32, supra.\n \n78. On June 15, 1959, Mr. Robinson issued a pricing directive entitled PRICING POLICY FOR TRANSFERS TO DU PONT DE NEMOURS to the Elastomer Chemicals, Textile Fibers, Electrochemicals, Polychemicals, Industrial and Biochemicals, Photo Products, and Fabrics and Finishes Departments. In substance, it implemented the profit-split proposed to the Executive Committee by the International, Treasurer’s and Legal Departments’ profit sanctuary memorandum of October 3, 1958. Finding 62, supra. Thus, the several industrial departments were instructed that where the total cost to make and sell an item was less than DISA’s selling price to independent third-parties the item was to be priced to DISA at manufacturing cost plus 25 percent of the overall profit realized on manufacture and sale of the item to an independent purchaser. The departments were further instructed that where the cost to make and sell was greater than DISA’s selling price the item was to be transferred to DISA at that selling price less all of DISA’s anticipated costs. Accordingly, the directive provided that where the sale to an independent purchaser yielded an overall profit DISA was to receive 75 percent of that profit, but where the sale resulted in an overall loss DISA was nonetheless to recover all of its costs.\n \nMr. Robinson explained that the directive was expressed in terms of profits based on full rather than marginal costs because, as heretofore noted, plaintiff maintained no records on an out-of-pocket cost basis. Finding 77, supra.\n \nAs to the appropriateness of the profit allocation, Mr. Robinson testified that both Mr. Russell Baker and Mr. Wentz were of the view that more than three-quarters of total profits should be allotted to DISA. According to Mr. Robinson, Mr. Baker advocated no specific percentage, taking the position only that 75 percent for DISA was entirely too conservative. Mr. Wentz urged that 90 percent of the total profit should go to DISA. The record fails to disclose that either man undertook to justify or otherwise explain to Mr. Robinson or any one else in plaintiff’s organization the basis for the more liberal profit allocation that he advocated.\n \n*64 Mr. Robinson acknowledged that the prices at which goods, most importantly neprene, were transferred to DISA from Du Pont (UK), plaintiff’s wholly-owned subsidiary, allotted DISA only one-half of total profit instead of the three-quarters share that it was to receive on goods transferred from plaintiff’s industrial departments. He explained that the reason for this more modest allocation of profit to DISA was that United Kingdom taxing authorities, operating under a law that required transfers between related entities to be on an ‘arm’s length’ basis (finding 54, supra), simply would not permit DISA to realize more than one-half of total profits (calculated on a full cost basis) for the selling function that it performed. When asked whether the same standard (the bare avoidance of anticipated objection by government taxing officials) determined the prices at which all goods were transferred to DISA, Mr. Robinson responded:\nIn essence yes, from the standpoint that it was a price that would satisfy in the case of Du Pont UK, the UK taxing authorities.\n \nWe were trying to establish a price to Du Pont [DISA] from Du Pont US that would satisfy the US tax authorities. From the Dutch standpoint we were establishing a price that was satisfactory to the Dutch authorities.\n \nYes, that was the principal criteri[on].\n \n \nAs previously noted, the Orlon transferred to DISA from plaintiff’s wholly-owned Dutch manufacturing subsidiary was priced on a basis that would yield DISA 80 percent of the total profit realized from manufacture and sale. Findings 64 and 65, supra.\n \nSince there is no suggestion in the evidence or contention by the plaintiff that the marketing services rendered by DISA differed in any way in respect to neoprene that it obtained from Du Pont (UK) rather than plaintiff or Orlon that came from DU Pont (Nederland) as opposed to plaintiff’s Textile Fibers Department, the disparate pricing of the same articles, differentiated only by the source of production, tangibly demonstrates that the amount of profit allocated to DISA was not based on any qualitative assessment of the value of the services that it rendered.\n \n79. In 1959 DISA received 48.3 percent of the total profit (determined on a full cost basis) realized on goods that it sold after manufacture and transfer to it by plaintiff. DISA did not become operational until September 1 of that year. Until then, its staff was occupied with such organizational matters as securing quarters, interviewing and hiring employees, arranging for housing for relocated employees and schooling for their children, and the sundry items associated with the establishment of an organization capable of assuming the marketing functions that DISA was expected to undertake.\n \nFor 1960 DISA received 57.1 percent of total profit with plaintiff retaining the remaining 42.9 percent.\n \nMr. Robinson explained that DISA’s failure to receive three-quarters of the entire profit, in accordance with the explicit terms of the pricing formula that he promulgated, was due primarily to the inclusion of certain items in manufacturing costs for pricing purposes that were not costs at all but increments of departmental profit. These profit items were generated by interdepartmental transfers of work-in-process. Those transfers occurred in instances where manufacture of the product transferred to DISA by an industrial department required one or more ingredients that the transferor department obtained from other industrial departments within plaintiff’s corporate structure. In such situations, in keeping with plaintiff’s established policy of recognizing each industrial department as a separate profit center, the ingredients involved were transferred to the acquiring department not at the transferor department’s cost but at that figure plus a profit increment that typically represented the difference between actual cost and fair market value. As a senior member of the Treasurer’s Department, Mr. Robinson was fully aware of this long-established policy on the pricing of interdepartmental transfers when he formulated the pricing structure that was to govern sales to DISA. It is equally clear, however, that in designing that structure he did not contemplate a dilution of the profit apportioned to DISA by virtue of the inclusion in manufacturing cost of profits arising from interdepartmental transfers of raw material or work-in-process. Examination of the exhibits referred to in findings 42, 62 and 75, supra, discloses nothing to suggest that the proposal to fix prices for intercompany transfers to DISA at a level calculated to yield it three-quarters of total profit took notice or account of the existence or effect on interdepartmental transfers. Accordingly, to the extent that profits on interdepartmental transfers prevented DISA from receiving a full 75 percent of the entire profit realized on its sale to independent purchasers of goods manufactured by plaintiff, that result was the fortuitous and unanticipated consequence of plaintiff’s general policy governing the pricing of interdepartmental transfers of material (as opposed to services, which were customarily furnished at actual cost).\n \n*65 Similarly, unanticipated by the pricing directive of June 15, 1959 (finding 78, supra), was the fact that in the years in suit DISA incurred some losses on its handling of a few items suplied it by plaintiff. None of those items represented as much as 1 percent of DISA’s total sales for the periods in which the losses occurred. The evidence fairly suggests that the losses experienced were attributable to the excessive burden of allocated expenses on the very small volume of merchandise involved. In all other respects throughout the years in suit the June 15 pricing formula achieved its intended objective of insulating DISA from loss.\n \n\nVII. DISA’s Operations\n80. As plaintiff advised its European distributors (finding 70, supra), DISA was formed to assist them in developing markets for Du Pont products, not to supplant their traditional sales function. Essentially, DISA’s mission was to implement in Europe the same general marketing strategy that plaintiff had applied so successfully in the United States beginning in the late 1940s. Finding 35, supra. The major difference in the two approaches was to be that whereas, with relatively inconsequential exceptions pertaining primarily to the commodity area, plaintiff conducts the entire marketing effort in the United States with its own people and finances, the European distributor was to continue performing the entrepreneurial functions of purchasing Du Pont products for his own account, maintaining adequate working inventories of such products and reselling the same to the trade while bearing the associated financial responsibilities relating to credit extension and collection of accounts. DISA’s predominant role, therefore, was that of a service organization designed to increase the effectiveness of the distributors’ selling efforts.\n \nFrom plaintiff’s standpoint, DISA’s ultimate objective was to create a sustained demand for plaintiff’s proprietary products in Europe sufficient in magnitude to justify the construction of local manufacturing facilities of an economically profitable size.\n \n81. Both before and after the formation of DISA plaintiff’s European distributors were expected to do the following:\n1. Solicit orders from trade customers.\n \n2. Maintain adequate inventories of plaintiff’s products.\n \n3. Bill trade customers, extend credit as necessary and collect accounts receivable.\n \n4. Advertise and promote plaintiff’s products.\n \n5. Provide technical advice and assistance to purchasers and users of plaintiff’s products.\n \n6. Handle customer complaints.\n \n7. Train sales personnel of trade customers in selling techniques and related services.\n \n8. Negotiate and obtain insurance, licenses and permits necessary to the movement of plaintiff’s products.\n \n9. Make market surveys.\n \n10. Compile statistical, accounting, financial and trade information.\n \n \nBoth before and after the formation of DISA the distributors performed the above functions with varying degrees of thoroughness and effectiveness. One of DISA’s initial undertakings was to make a qualitative assessment of plaintiff’s distributor network in Europe. Those distributors found to be obviously unable or unwilling to put forth a genuine effort to really merchandise plaintiff’s proprietary products, as opposed to simply soliciting and filling customer orders for the same, were terminated and replaced either by other independents who were more receptive to the use of plaintiff’s marketing methods, as communicated to them by DISA, or, by plaintiff-controlled distributorships that were of course totally committed to those methods. The standard form of plaintiff’s franchise agreements with its distributors provided for termination on 90 days notice. In the first 18 months of its existence DISA terminated approximately 10 percent of plaintiff’s independent distributors in Europe. In most instances they were replaced by plaintiff-owned or controlled distributorships.\n \n*66 Plaintiff compensated its distributors by a system of price discounts ranging from 4 (textile fibers) or 5 (elastomers) to 35 percent (photo products and biochemicals), the size of the discount varied in direct proportion to the amount of effort and expense that plaintiff thought necessary for the proper merchandising of the product involved. Each level of discount comprehended a determinate element of residual profit for the distributor. The target profit element varied from 1 1/2 to 6 or 7 percent of resale price. The more difficult the distributor’s merchandising job, as reflected by the size of the authorized discount, the greater the allowance for profit.\n \n82. In October 1964, in the course of the audit examinations that culminated in the assessment of the deficiencies that are the subject of this suit plaintiff submitted to the Internal Revenue Service a 47-page statement entitled PURPOSES AND FUNCTIONS OF DU PONT DE NEMOURS INTERNATIONAL SA (DISA). Included in that statement under the heading ‘Description of DISA’s Functions’ was the following enumeration:\n1. Purchasing for resale of products manufactured by Du Pont and its European subsidiaries.\n \n2. Making arrangements for transportation of products from the United States or other countries of manufacture to foreign destinations.\n \n3. Maintaining and coordinating inventories of products in warehouses at levels consistent with requirements for quick delivery.\n \n4. Soliciting orders from customers and billing customers for materials shipped.\n \n5. Investigating customers’ credit, establishing credit lines, granting of credit and collection of accounts receivable.\n \n6. Promoting and advertising of products in the different languages and in the styling appropriate for the various countries.\n \n7. Providing technical advice and assistance to customers and users of products.\n \n8. Handling complaints concerning the quality or performance of products.\n \n9. Training sales personnel of the distributor-customers in selling techniques and services.\n \n10. Purchasing for resale of products manufactured by other unrelated companies when necessary to complete product lines.\n \n11. Negotiating for and obtaining proper insurance coverage, licenses, permits, etc.\n \n12. Making market surveys for the various products and countries to guide DISA’s selling efforts.\n \n13. Preparing statistical, accounting and financial data.\n \n14. Performing special service functions for parent in Europe (investigation of markets for new product manufacture, etc.).\n \n \nSubject to the addition of one function not included in the above enumeration and provided that certain of the terms appearing therein are understood in the context of the undisputed evidence in the case, the activities listed above are realistically descriptive of the character of DISA’s role in the marketing of plaintiff’s proprietary products in Europe during the years in suit.\n \nExcept for the maintenance of product inventories in European warehouses sufficient in variety and quantity to provide distributors with an adequate and reliable source of supply, DISA’s contribution to the successful marketing of plaintiff’s products in Europe was basically embodied in the services that were rendered by DISA employees; this as opposed to significant risk assumption or capital contribution by DISA. The evidence shows that DISA’s employees performed their assigned responsibilities in a capable and conscientious manner. Accordingly, its ability to execute in the quantitative sense, the activities listed above was limited by its available manpower.\n \n*67 83. An important function served by DISA but omitted from the activity list set forth in the preceding finding was that of overseeing the pricing practices of plaintiff’s European distributors.\n \nAs earlier noted, one of a distributor’s traditional responsibilities was to ‘negotiate and obtain insurance, licenses and permits necessary to the movement of plaintiff’s products.’ Finding 81, supra.\n \nMr. David H. Conklin, DISA’s first managing director, testified as a witness for the plaintiff in this proceeding. The following colloquy with plaintiff’s attorney identifies those distributor pricing practices whose correction was DISA’s concern:\nQ. I think I interrupted you. You were saying that one of the more pressing matters you dealt with upon the formation of DISA was the matter of distributors?\n \nA. Yes.\n \nQ. What was the nature of that matter?\n \nA. Well, we just didn’t know what they were doing. The export people from the United States did not get around often enough to know how they were pricing, what sort of charges they were making against us, and what we wanted to do was make * * * sure that we had the proper price on the material so that it would be used in the marketplace to expand our market as much as possible.\n \nIt was the pricing, it was the overcharging, the interesting tricks that they were pulling that we had to police them on. [Emphasis added.]\n \n* * *\n \nQ. Now, are the practices of distributors as you described them unique or exceptional or was it your view that this was the usual practice of distributors?\n \nA. This was the usual practice. It had been ever since the early post-war years. When a distributor’s primary job was to get the commercial papers, the import permits that would let him bring something into the country. When they did that they could do almost anything they wanted to as far as the pricing was concerned. [Emphasis added.]\n \n \nThe president of plaintiff’s independent distributor of neoprene in France also testified as a witness for the plaintiff and confirmed both the existence of the problems that Mr. Conklin described and the remedial influence of DISA thereon. He explained:\nA. Well, all over the period after the war until 1959, we pretty much acted for the distribution of duPont elastomers in the way we thought fit, which was not always the way duPont Export Managers thought fit. And the fact duPont was going to have what was already described as a fairly large organization for the marketing of the products in Europe could create some fear in distributors who had not followed the pattern underlined by duPont.\n \nQ. In what respects had your company been acting in a manner that was not fit from the point of view of the Export Managers of duPont?\n \nA. Well, first of all, we overcharged the customers much above the level of price suggested by duPont. We did this with little discrimination as to the importance of the customer.\n \nAnd third, we overcharged duPont on some handling charges which they would pay.\n \n*68 Q. Take that last category first. Would you give us some detail of what you mean by overcharging duPont on handling charges?\n \nA. Well, we bought from duPont material, cost and freight, on c. i. f. terms, c. i. f., cost insurance and freight, on c. i. f. terms, in U. S. dollars. And price in French frances, delivered to the customer, was suggested by duPont.\n \nSo a calculation had to be made as to what price duPont had to sell us so that we would get our normal distributor’s margin. But if we could overcharge duPont on some of the handling charges, duPont would sell us that much less because of a bigger difference, and so our profit, if we—if the charges were not true, would be bigger. [Emphasis added.]\n \n \nBecause, as indicated by item 11 of the tabulation set forth in finding 82, supra, one of DISA’s functions was to arrange for the insurance, transit and importation of plaintiff’s United States-produced products into European markets it had direct knowledge of the landed cost of those products to the European distributors and was therefore able to effectively control distributor margins and ensure conformity with plaintiff’s applicable policies. In sum, stripped of the responsibility of arranging for the insurance, shipment and entry into European markets of plaintiff’s United States-produced products, the local distributors no longer had the opportunity, described by Mr. Conklin, to fictionally infiate their landed costs of merchandise in order to realize profit margins greater than those that plaintiff was prepared to allow and mistakenly thought that it was allowing.\n \nThe bare fact of DISA’s permanent presence in the trading area inhibited local distributors from sacrificing or prejudicing volume opportunities by attempting to sell plaintiff’s products at prices materially higher than those suggested by plaintiff for resale. To that extent DISA tended to ameliorate the other major distributor pricing practice that plaintiff found detrimental to its interests, as related by Mr. Conklin.\n \n84. As indicated in finding 82, supra, the other qualification on the representativeness of the 14-item characterization of DISA’s marketing functions, as set forth therein, is the necessity for clarification of the proper connotation of some of the terms appearing in the listing; terms such as ‘resale,’ ‘customers,’ ‘credit’ and ‘collection.’\n \nTo establish the nature of the functions and operations performed by DISA plaintiff’s proof included the testimony of two other DISA executives in addition to Mr. Conklin. They were Russell C. Nelson, DISA’s marketing manager and director of sales during the period in suit, and Morrison C. Huston, marketing manager for Textile Fibers, DISA’s largest product line. In substance, the testimony of each of these credible witnesses was to the same effect.\n \nBoth Mr. Conklin and Mr. Nelson testified specifically that they conceived DISA’s role to be that of the ‘Wilmington’ of Europe. By that they meant that its functions were to be in the area of marketing management aimed at the coordination and direction of distributor selling effort and the consequent increase in effectiveness of that effort. In that capacity DISA’s major responsibilities were in the development, dissemination and execution of marketing strategies adapted to European markets; the supply of technical information and assistance, both for the purpose of increasing distributor sales and resolving the product complaints of trade users; supervision of the formulation and implementation of advertising and promotion programs, and generally observing the operations of distributors and offering suggestions for the improvement thereof. In sum, these men describe DISA as a service organization operating in support of plaintiff’s European distributors, both independent and plaintiff-controlled. All of these men registered the clear understanding that DISA was to exert its marketing efforts through plaintiff’s distributors, never independent of them, except in the limited area of Switzerland itself. In fact, they believed that DISA was prohibited, as a matter of strict policy, from soliciting or accepting orders for plaintiff’s products from other than plaintiff’s distributors, who took title to the products that they handled, or its sales representatives, who did not—the sole exception to this policy being within the limited confines of Switzerland where DISA established its own distributorship. Accordingly, the vast preponderance of DISA’s credit and collection activities and all of its direct selling efforts (Switzerland excepted) were in relation to plaintiff’s distributors, not trade customers or users. Thus, Mr. Nelson testified that the extension of trade credit and the collection of trade receivables were the responsibility of the local distributors, not DISA. Aside from the limited direct selling done on the Swiss market, it appears that the only credit and collection functions that DISA performed other than in relation to plaintiff’s distributors were in connection with isolated instances of so-called opportunistic sales. These occurred when a distributor or commission-basis sales representative referred to DISA an order from a European producer for a raw material item required for its production operations and otherwise unavailable to it. In these situations DISA would ship or cause shipment of the materials involved directly to the producer-customer, bill that customer directly and in due course collect the bill. In the normal course of DISA’s business, however, it sold only to plaintiff’s distributors and performed credit and collection functions only in relation to them. Thus, when plaintiff used the term ‘customers’ in its characterization to the Internal Revenue Service of DISA’s selling, credit and collection functions it should be understood that the intended reference was to plaintiff’s distributors rather than unrelated trade purchasers and users.\n \n*69 85. Although, as indicated both by the standard of comparability with unrelated entities performing similar services and by the comparatively excessive rate of return that it realized on the total capital that it employed in its operations, the value of the services rendered by DISA was not commensurate with the compensation allotted it by plaintiff, the evidence satisfactorily demonstrated that DISA was created to serve legitimate commercial objectives and that its operations benefited plaintiff’s effort to successfully market its proprietary products in Europe.\n \n86. Eight of plaintiff’s industrial departments sold products to DISA in 1959 and 1960. On September 1, 1959, it began handling products of the Textile Fibers and Elastomer Chemicals Departments. In October 1959, it added products of the Electrochemicals, Fabrics and Finishes, Plastics, and Photo Products Departments and in January 1960, those of the Industrial and Biochemical Department. Finally, in October 1960, it added products of the Film Department. Plaintiff’s Organic Chemicals, Pigments, and Explosive Departments did not sell to DISA during the years in suit.\n \n87. The following table reflects the respective percentages of DISA’s 1959 and 1960 total sales and total operative earnings accounted for by the products indicated:\n \n\n\n\n\n|Sales\n \n|Operative Earnings\n \n|\nProduct\n \n|1959\n \n|1960\n \n|1959\n \n|1960\n \n|\nNeoprene\t\n \n|37.2%\n \n|34.1%\n \n|47.0%\n \n|43.1%\n \n|\nNylon\t\n \n|25.0%\n \n|24.4%\n \n|21.0%\n \n|18.8%\n \n|\nOrlon\t\n \n|23.3%\n \n|16.9%\n \n|21.2%\n \n|18.3%\n \n|\nDacron\t\n \n|8.0%\n \n|6.3%\n \n|13.1%\n \n|9.9%\n \n|\nPolyethylene\t\n \n|1.7%\n \n|5.2%\n \n|.9%\n \n|3.8%\n \n|\nFinishes\t\n \n|.8%\n \n|1.6%\n \n|.5%\n \n|.8%\n \n|\nBiochemicals\t\n \n||.7%\n \n||1.0%\n \n|\nMylar polyester film\t\n \n||.6%\n \n||.5%\n \n|\nIndustrial Chemicals\t\n \n||.6%\n \n||.9%\n \n|\nX-ray products\t\n \n|.1%\n \n|.3%\n \n|(1.0)%\n \n|.1%\n \n|\nMotion picture film\t\n \n|.1%\n \n|.3%\n \n|.03%\n \n|.2%\n \n|\nCellulose film\t\n \n||.3%\n \n||.01%\n \n|\nSodium products\t\n \n|.04%\n \n|.2%\n \n||.2%\n \n|\nVinyl products\t\n \n|.5%\n \n|.3%\n \n|(.5)%\n \n|.1%\n \n|\nFabrics\t\n \n|1.0%\n \n|.2%\n \n|(.8)%\n \n|.07%\n \n|\n\n\n\n\n*70 88. Although plaintiff created DISA to provide it with a permanent identity with the European trading community within which its mission was to generate sufficient demand for Du Pont products to justify the construction of local manufacturing facilities of an economically feasible size, sales to customers in such remote locations as Australia and South Africa were routed through DISA rather than being made directly, as theretofore, by the export sections of plaintiff’s industrial departments. The following table reflects the geographic areas in which DISA’s sales were primarily concentrated during the years in suit:\n \n\n\n\n\nArea\n \n|1959 Sales\n \n|1960 Sales\n \n|\nEngland\t\n \n|$5,390,409\n \n|$26,476,512\n \n|\nWest Germany\t\n \n|4,485,254\n \n|25,299,646\n \n|\nFrance\t\n \n|2,270,290\n \n|11,262,140\n \n|\nItaly\t\n \n|1,511,596\n \n|9,709,375\n \n|\nAustralia\t\n \n|786,224\n \n|9,600,768\n \n|\nNetherlands\t\n \n|445,569\n \n|4,175,572\n \n|\nSweden\t\n \n|793,247\n \n|3,795,636\n \n|\nSwitzerland\t\n \n|903,353\n \n|3,149,394\n \n|\nDenmark\t\n \n|451,771\n \n|2,534,477\n \n|\nSouth Africa\t\n \n|254,291\n \n|2,341,168\n \n|\n\n\n\n\nThe available evidence does not show that, as in the case of Europe, DISA was able to provide significantly better or different marketing services and assistance to distributors in Australia and South Africa than were the industrial departments whose products were sold in those countries during 1959 and 1960. It does not appear that, apart from tax considerations, there was a substantial economic inducement for routing sales to those areas through DISA, certainly not an economic benefit sufficient to justify the markup permitted DISA for performing a resale function. Under the pricing arrangement instituted by the plaintiff, DISA’s markup during each of the years in suit averaged 26 percent of the price at which it resold the goods that were transferred to it. Its operating expenses for 1959 and 1960 amounted to only 9.15 and 6.45 percent, respectively, of resale price.\n \n89. DISA was permitted to select its staff from plaintiff’s work force. In December 1959, DISA was employing 59 persons engaged in supervisory, technical, marketing and professional work. Of that number, 33 were transferees from plaintiff. By the end of 1960 DISA had increased the number of employees so engaged to 112, of whom 51 were transferees from plaintiff and its subsidiaries.\n \n90. During the years in suit DISA’s only technical facility was a small laboratory in Geneva for testing textile fibers. It undertook no research or product development work. It was not equipped or staffed to do so. For elastomers work DISA had access to a substantial and well-equipped technical service and development laboratory owned by Du Pont (UK) and located at Hemel Hempstead, England. DISA’s distributor-customers and their trade customers received substantial technical information and assistance from Hemel Hempstead during the years in suit. The evidence does not show, however, that Du Pont (UK) received any payment from DISA in consideration of such information and services. The absence of payment for the cost of such services was at variance with plaintiff’s established policy. Finding 79, supra. That policy was observed, however, with respect to the technical, promotional and training services supplied DISA by the various industrial departments headquartered at Wilmington. Thus, DISA was billed at cost for the technical work done for it at Chestnut Run (finding 26, supra), for the technical publications and promotional materials supplied DISA from Wilmington and for the training of personnel sent to Wilmington by DISA for acquisition of the skills and knowledge necessary to satisfy performance of their assigned duties as DISA employees. DISA’s payments to plaintiff for those services amounted to $551,404 in 1959 and $737,749 in 1960. The substantial extent to which DISA relied on plaintiff’s talent and technical resources for assistance in performing its marketing functions is evident both from the size of the cost reimbursements, in absolute terms, and from the fact that those payments represented 32.6 percent of DISA’s total operating expenses in 1959 and 10.7 percent in 1960.\n \n*71 91. The evidence shows that during the years in suit DISA fulfilled the prophecy (finding 67, supra) that its presence would not appreciably increase sales of elastomer products in European markets. During that period its activities, frequently hampered by shortages of key personnel, did not materially strengthen plaintiff’s position in Europe beyond that which had been achieved and was sustained by the well-directed efforts and resources of Du Pont (UK).\n \n92. DISA’s marketing efforts in textile fibers, its largest single product line consisting primarily of nylon, Orlon and Dacron, were more intensive, more adequately manned and generally more effective than those in the elastomers area. These efforts were patterned on those that had earlier been employed in marketing of textile fibers in the United States. Finding 35, supra. Thus, the principal emphasis was on creating a sustained demand for Du Pont fibers at those points in the manufacturing and distribution chain beyond the distributors’ immediate customers, down to and including the retailer of consumer items made from one or more of plaintiff’s proprietary products. This effort by DISA required a properly coordinated blend of technical assistance, promotional work and advertising. The expense of these activities, many of which produced no immediate sales results, was justified by their tendency to establish, over a period of time, a solid demand for plaintiff’s fibers from the most desirable members of each level in the chain of processing and distribution that led to the ultimate purchaser, the consumer. It was this type of market development work that was DISA’s primary operating responsibility, as conceived by the plaintiff. In turn, it was the successful performance of this work that, according to plaintiff, mainly justifies the compensation that was allotted DISA by the pricing structure that plaintiff applied to it. In fact, however, the evidence shows that under that pricing arrangement DISA was allotted as much compensation in respect to those goods that it resold on a so-called opportunistic basis, as defined in finding 33, supra, as it was on those to be marketed through the regular commercial channels and therefore called for the type of marketing effort previously described. For example, during the years in suit DISA made opportunistic sales totaling $13,899,200 to European fiber producers on which it realized gross profits of more than three million dollars. These sales, of course, had no positive effect on plaintiff’s standing or position in European markets. If anything, they tended to undermine that position by providing competitive producers with the indispensable wherewithal to place goods on the market that might otherwise never have been produced at all. Certainly plaintiff had no desire to utilize the services of DISA to strengthen the market position of its competitors.\n \nCommodity-type products, as defined in finding 18, supra, intrinsically require none of the marketing efforts employed to effectively merchandise proprietary products. Nonetheless, during the years in suit DISA was permitted to realize operative earnings of some $960,000 on sales of approximately $6,500,000 worth of commodity items such as high pressure polyethylene and industrial chemicals.\n \n*72 It cannot reasonably be concluded from the evidence that, aside from tax benefit, there was economic justification for DISA receiving the margins that were allowed it on commodity-type items or on products that were destined for resale by it on an opportunistic basis.\n \n93. On the business that it did with each of the industrial departments from which it obtained products for resale, the following table reflects DISA’s sales, cost of goods sold, gross profit, selling expense, administrative expense, and operative earnings for 1959 and 1960 (figures in thousands):\n \n\n\n\n\n1959\n \n|\nDepartment\n \n|Net Sales\n \n|Cost of Goods Sold\n \n|Gross Profit\n \n|Selling Expense\n \n|Admin.

As one of the means (supplementary to debt and equity financing) of providing DISA working capital, plaintiff adopted a trade credit policy that afforded DISA more time, on the average, to remit on its payables than was consumed in collecting its receivables. Thus, during the discovery phase of this suit plaintiff responded in the following manner to an interrogratory directed to the trade credit terms that it extended DISA and that the latter extended distributors and other customers. As to credit extended DISA, plaintiff stated: ‘The standard credit terms which plaintiff extended to DISA in 1959 and 1960 were 90 days for all trade transactions, except for shorter terms in a few isolated instances. These terms remained in effect without modification in those years.’ Plaintiff defined the trade credit extended by DISA as follows: ‘The normal credit terms which DISA extended to its distributors in 1959 and 1960 varied between cash and 90 days with a few instances of still longer terms. In comparing Days Sales Outstanding (corresponding approximately to average terms granted) at December 31, 1959, with similar figures at December 31, 1960, it is found that Days Sales Outstanding increased from 47 days at the end of 1959 to 70 days at the end of 1960. Part of the increase is attributable to a trend to extend longer terms to major distributors and customers between 1959 and 1960 as well as to new distributors and customers added during 1960.’ As DISA generated and accumulated progressively greater profits out of which to finance its operations it remitted on its trade payables to plaintiff with increasing promptness. For example, there is evidence in the record showing that by October 1960, DISA had reduced its accounts payable to plaintiff to 25 days outstanding.\n \nAs reflected by the fact that its provision for bad debts was less than one-tenth of one percent of sales, DISA selected its customers with such care as to essentially avoid credit risk.\n \n98.

He also acknowledged his own understanding that enactment of the Revenue Act of 1962 was a factor prompting dividend distribution. In fact, the above-listed dividend distributions constituted the minimum distributions specified for a ‘controlled foreign corporation’ such as DISA by the provisions of the Revenue Act of 1962. Section 963, Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as amended.\n \n100. During the period in suit DISA’s presence and participation in the marketing of plaintiff’s products increased neither the volume of plaintiff’s sales in the area serviced by DISA nor the unit prices obtained for the products involved in those sales. The evidence does, however, support the dual premises (1) that plaintiff did not create DISA simply as a means of achieving tax minimization but did so primarily for the legitimate commercial purpose of improving both the efficiency and effectiveness of its selling efforts in the Common Market area, and (2) that had there been no DISA and had the marketing functions that it performed not been provided by others acting on plaintiff’s behalf, sales of Du Pont products in the Common Market area would not have achieved the levels that were attained with DISA’s participation. Though DISA’s immediate objective was to stimulate the sale of plaintiff’s products in Europe, its ultimate mission was to establish and solidify a sales base of sufficient magnitude to justify the construction of economically efficient production facilities within the Common Market. To the extent that tax savings realized by DISA could provide funds for financing such facility construction, plaintiff’s top management was understandably receptive to proposals by its legal and financial people for maximizing such savings within the limits of what those people represented that the law would allow. In order of priority, however, the development of markets sufficient to sustain European production took precedence over such tax savings as could be achieved incident to the development activities.\n \n\nVIII. The Arm’s Length Value of DISA’s Marketing Functions\n*78 101. The parties agree, and their agreement is supported by the record, that there is not known to exist, presently or heretofore, an independent organization circumstanced as DISA was during the period in suit and performing the marketing functions that were assigned it by plaintiff. Finding 82, supra. Moreover, the disclosure of proprietary information essential to adequate performance of the critically important technical aspects of those assigned functions would effectively rule out the feasibility of plaintiff’s utilizing the services of an independent outsider to discharge them.\n \nA. Plaintiff’s Evidence 102. Plaintiff called as its principal expert witness Dr. Robert B. Stobaugh, Jr., a professor of business administration in the Harvard Business School. Dr. Stobaugh’s education and experience qualified him as an expert in the general economics and marketing areas of the chemical industry. Dr. Stobaugh was called upon to express an opinion as to the economic value to the plaintiff of the marketing services rendered it by DISA in the Common Market area. He assumed that during the period in suit the services rendered by DISA were as described in the International Department’s memorandum of December 18, 1958 to plaintiff’s Executive Committee. Finding 67, supra. The services in question were described therein as follows:\nThe over-all sales functions of Du Pont International can be summarized as follows:\n \n1. Establish European sales policies within a framework agreed with the Industrial Departments and the European subsidiaries. Plan and direct European sales programs, make contractual agreements with distributors and sales agents, supervise and insure proper sales performance, prepare sales forecasts, conduct market surveys, initiate more efficient and effective warehousing, and determine the optimum method of supply and shipping.\n \n2. Accept and acknowledge orders and sales contracts, maintain proper inventories, approve credit terms, issue invoices and collect from customers, and pay distributor commissions.\n \n3. Insure proper relations with customers. Provide better support of the distributor sales effort with improved technical service, merchandising, product publicity, advertising, promotion, and product delivery.\n \nAn additional function of Du Pont International will be to locate, study, and coordinate new manufacturing ventures in Europe either to establish new markets for du Pont products or to retain existing or expanded markets built up through exports.\n \n \nOn the basis of the above activities, as confirmed to Dr. Stobaugh’s satisfaction by his discussions fit various DISA employees, he concluded that for doing the job that DISA did an independent marketing organization, negotiating with plaintiff at arm’s length, would have been able to command a gross operating margin of 32 percent (i. e., it would have been able to purchase products from plaintiff at prices that were 32 percent less than the prices at which it would resell those products to independent Du Pont distributors). He then detailed the assumptions and reasoning by which he derived that margin figure. That exposition disclosed material differences between several of Dr. Stobaugh’s underlying factual assumptions and the actualities of DISA’s operations and, more importantly, between the risk position that he attributed to the hypothetical independent marketing organization that he constructed for purposes of comparison and the risk position actually assumed by DISA. As will be seen, that element was of predominant importance in shaping the gross margin figure at which Dr. Stobaugh arrived.\n \n*79 Dr. Stobaugh hypothesized, first, that plaintiff would not be willing to entrust responsibility for the marketing of its products in Europe to a stranger without the right to terminate the stranger’s services on 90 days notice after the first year and on the expiration of each year thereafter. Similarly, he assumed that an independent organization would be unable to attract the skills necessary to satisfactory performance of the marketing function without guaranteeing the personnel involved employment for a minimum of 5 years. He also felt that such persons would be unwilling to leave their existing positions unless offered salaries and benefits that were double the amount that DISA gave its transferees from Du Pont.\n \nNext, Dr. Stobaugh assumed that a stranger would be unwilling to take on the assignment, subject to the vulnerability of preemptory termination, unless his compensation was sufficient to fully fund the cost of a termination that would occur at the end of 1960, that being 16 months from the inception of DISA’s marketing operations on September 1, 1959. Finding 79, supra. Dr. Stobaugh reasoned that termination would subject the marketer to loss of 25 percent of his working capital (consisting primarily of uncollectable receivables) and 50 percent of his investment in fixed assets. Those losses, he hypothesized, would amount to approximately $5,500,000. Parenthetically, it should be noted that putting aside the validity of his bad debt and worthlessness of fixed asset assumptions, the figures that he used for total working capital and fixed asset investment closely approximated DISA’s actual figures for these items. The third and largest category of putative termination cost, $8,500,000, represented the remaining balance of salary due the personnel that had been recruited under 5-year contracts of employment.\n \nDr. Stobaugh hypothesized that 17 percent of the marketer’s sales for the first 16 months of operations would be required to generate the $14,000,000 termination contingency fund described above. That percentage, of course, proceeded from a presupposed volume of sales. He projected sales volume as $18,000,000 for the 4-month period of 1959 and $63,000,000 for 1960, the latter figure amounting to a 25 percent increase over 1959 sales on an annualized basis. Seventeen percent of his projected sales ($18,000,000 plus $63,000,000) yields the targeted contingency fund figure of $14,000,000. While the figure projected for 1959 closely approximated DISA’s actual sales for that year, the figure used for 1960 fell far short of DISA’s actual sales of more than $107,000,000. Accordingly, whereas a 17 percent gross margin of Dr. Stobaugh’s projected sales would be needed to generate a $14,000,000 fund, a margin little more than one-third that amount, applied to DISA’s actual sales, would generate $14,000,000. The other component of the 32 percent gross margin for which Dr. Stobaugh advocated was predicated on an assumption equally far removed from reality. Specifically, he assumed that in order to do its job properly the independent marketer would necessarily incur selling and administrative expenses equal to 15 percent of its net sales. While that assumption is entirely reasonable in the context of the job that was supposed to be done, the fact of the matter is that DISA’s operating expenses totaled only 9.15 percent of sales for 1959 and 6.45 percent for 1960. Finding 88, supra. The greater percentage of expenses for 1959 is largely attributable to the inclusion of $275,863 that represented start-up expenses of an organizational nature that were incurred prior to September 1, 1959, when DISA began selling. Without the inclusion of that burden DISA’s 1959 operating expenses amounted to less than 7.7 percent of its net sales. In sum, as contrasted with Dr. Stobaugh’s assumption that operating expenses would consume 17 percent of an independent marketer’s revenue from sales, DISA’s operating expenses for all of 1960 and the operational portion of 1959 represented approximately 6.76 percent of its net sales. Aside from Dr. Stobaugh’s stated assumption, unsupported by extrinsic evidence, that an independent marketer would have had to compensate its skilled personnel at twice the rate that DISA paid the transferees that it obtained from plaintiff, there is nothing in the record to support the thesis that it would have cost an independent appreciably more than it did DISA to provide the marketing services that the latter in fact rendered plaintiff.\n \n*80 Finally, Dr. Stobaugh essentially equated the allowance of a 32 percent gross margin to the marketer with a 60–40 percent split, in favor of the marketer, of manufacturing and selling profit on all products manufactured by Du Pont and sold by the marketer. Because the newly-formed marketer would inherit at least the bulk of the substantial business that plaintiff was already doing with European distributors, Dr. Stobaugh opined that a 50–50 split of overall net profit would best represent fai compensation for an independent performing DISA’s marketing function and itself supplying the capital needed to do so. He felt that a share of net profit would be preferable to the allowance of a fixed percentage of gross margin because it would heighten the marketer’s entrepreneurial interest and stake in the success of the venture. The extent to which the assumption of extrepreneurial risk, viz, exposure to the risk of operating loss and to the possibility of loss resulting from termination, justified the marketer’s entitlement to half of total profits is illustrated by Dr. Stobaugh’s acknowledgment that if the arrangement were one under which the manufacturer effectively insulated the marketer from those risks the latter’s participation in overall profit would decline from 50 to approximately 10 percent. The evidence shows that plaintiff priced its products to DISA in a manner calculated to insulate it from operating loss. Findings 78 and 79, supra. Moreover, it does not appear from the evidence that had plaintiff determined to dispense with DISA’s marketing services the latter would have been subject to the types of losses envisioned for an independent by Dr. Stobaugh. Certainly that is true with respect to the largest segment of such losses—that relating to the cost of liquidating obligations under 5-year employment contracts.\n \nIn sum, most of the compensation that Dr. Stobaugh allotted to a hypothetical independent entity for performing what he understood to be DISA’s marketing functions was attributable to such an entity’s assumption of entrepreneurial risks that DISA was not required to assume and in fact did not assume. When he equated the risk exposure of the hypothetical independent to that of DISA his assessment of the economic worth of the marketing services that plaintiff received was no more than that allowed by the Commissioner’s reallocation of income.\n \n103. Plaintiff also called as an expert witness Dr. Stanley Miller, formerly a member of the faculty of the Harvard Business School, and more recently the head of the London office of a management consulting firm specializing in business planning and market evaluation for multinational firms, some headquartered in the United States and doing business in Europe and others of European nationality doing business in the United States. Dr. Miller undertook, by applying marketing principles known to him by virtue of his expertise in the marketing area of economics and on the basis of factual information gained through personal observation of other enterprises that he deemed comparable, to place an arm’s length value on DISA’s contribution towards the marketing of plaintiff’s proprietary products, principally elastomers and textile fibers, in Europe.\n \n*81 Dr. Miller conceived DISA as being what he described as a marketing management organization. Such an organization, he posited, cannot be defined in terms solely of such functional characteristics as those attributed to DISA by the plaintiff. Finding 81, supra. An organization’s performance of such functions might constitute it as a marketing specialist or a marketing technician functioning in either event as a paid advisor, but not a marketing manager. In his view the indispensable ingredient of the latter classification is proprietorship entailing exposure to entrepreneurial risk. He defined that attribute, as applied to DISA, as involving ‘* * * a risk-taking function responsible for everything from manufacturing costs to finished price.’\n \nDr. Miller testified that his experience had exposed him to one analogue that he regarded as reasonably comparable to the Du Pont-DISA relationship. He described it as a joint venture formed in 1956 by a United States company, Haloid (now Xerox) and J. Arthur Rank of England, a well-established manufacturer and distributor of film in world markets, for the production and marketing of the Xerox copier outside of the United States and Canada. He related that a new company, Rank-Xerox, was formed in which the two participants held equal equity interests. As consideration for its stock Haloid contributed all of its copier technology, including patents. Rank contributed $3,000,000 for its one-half stock interest, the funds to provide working capital for the new company which was to both manufacture and market Xerox copiers. Until volume reached an agreed level the parties were to share profits and losses equally. Thereafter, Xerox was to receive two-thirds of profits and Rank the remaining one-third. Dr. Miller analogized the role of Xerox to that of plaintiff and Rank, which he conceived as a marketing manager with the appropriate attributes of proprietorship, to DISA.\n \nIt is apparent from the record that in its actual relationship to plaintiff DISA bore none of the attributes of proprietorship that characterized Rank’s role in the joint venture with Xerox. Unlike Xerox, plaintiff bore the entire manufacturing responsibility and provided all equity capital and loan funds used in the marketing effort. More significantly, DISA was effectively insulated from operating losses in which Rank was obliged to participate to an extent compensurate with its participation in profits.\n \nThe essence of Dr. Miller’s testimony was that a marketing management organization, as he defined it and as exemplified by Rank in the Rank-Xerox joint venture, was entitled for its efforts and contributions to approximately one-half of the total profit realized from the manufacture and subsequent distribution of the product involved.\n \nThe uncontradicted evidence shows that DISA was clearly not a marketing management organization, as perceived by Dr. Miller, because it lacked the essential attributes of entrepreneurship. By his standards, DISA was a marketing specialist functioning as a paid advisor. Dr. Miller’s testimony does not support the thesis that the fair market value of DISA’s services, rendered in that capacity, was greater than the compensation allowed it under the Commissioner’s allocation of income.\n \n*82 104. Another expert who testified for the plaintiff was Marvin Bower, a director and long-time employee of the management consulting firm of McKinsey & Company. Early in his testimony the following colloquy between plaintiff’s attorney and the witness occurred:\nQ. Have you ever had occasion in your work to attempt to split out the marketing function from the manufacturing function and ascribe a portion of the overall profits to each of those elements?\n \nA. No, we haven’t, because it is so—it would be so difficult to do. The interaction and interplay between marketing, manufacturing, research and development is too intricate, that to separate it out is a very difficult task and would require allocations that have no realistic basis. This is one total effort.\n \nQ. I take it you are not aware of any accepted formula for dividing profit between marketing and manufacturing?\n \nA. No, I am not aware of any formula. Ordinarily, if there is a basis for separation, it is just done on a negotiated or arbitrary basis. I don’t know of any way of calculating it.\n \n \nNotwithstanding the above acknowledgments, Mr. Bower went on to express the view that an organization performing the marketing functions that he understood DISA was performing for plaintiff would be entitled to receive as compensation one-half of the total profit derived from manufacture and sale of the products involved. He admitted, however, that in arriving at that opinion he did not take into account the relative apportionment of entrepreneurial risk as between the manufacturer and the marketing. Focusing on that consideration, he later testified that if he were to assume that, as was the case with DISA, the manufacturer agreed to insulate the marketer from operating loss and, further, that the marketer was succeeding to an existing market for the manufacturer’s products, then the marketer’s compensation should be reduced from 50 percent of total profit to, at most, 20 percent. Accordingly, the expert opinion of Mr. Bower, when applied to the facts as they existed, supports rather than refutes the adequacy of the compensation allowed DISA under the Commissioner’s reallocation of income.\n \n105. By 1960 plaintiff’s Photo Products Department had developed a color transparency film that was superior to Eastman Kodak’s Kodachrome I, the film with which Eastman was servicing 95 percent of the still and 97 percent of the movie film market in this country. With the technology of its new film in hand the question confronting the Photo Products Department was the development of a marketing program that would compete effectively with the entrenched Eastman product. By a memorandum of May 11, 1961, to plaintiff’s Executive Committee, the department presented a detailed statement of its analysis of the marketing problem and a specific proposal for its solution.\n \nThe memorandum set forth the following criteria for a successful marketing program:\n1. It is necessary to establish the Du Pont name in the color film market. Accordingly, our product should always carry prominent Du Pont identification.\n \n*83 2. Pricing, except for the previously described processing charge, should be competitive with products of comparable quality.\n \n3. To provide maximum convenience to customers, and to insure highest quality in processing, our film should be sold with processing included in the sales price. This pricing method would provide an important competitive advantage denied to Eastman under a 1955 consent decree which prohibits their selling on this basis. Processing should be accomplished through contractual arrangements with selected photofinishers in order to obtain\n \na. Organizations skilled in processing,\n \nb. Lower costs through both greater volume and lower labor rates.\n \nDu Pont should provide technical assistance and surveillance to the photofinishers’ operations to obtain desired processing quality levels. Since such technical effort will represent a major contribution to processing operations, Du Pont should participate in the profits therefrom. [Emphasis added.]\n \n4. An alliance with an existing manufacturer and distributor of photographic equipment to the amateur consumer market should be made by Du Pont to\n \na. Answer the mutual needs of the equipment manufacturer and the film manufacturer with respect to the existing and the expected increased interdependence of film and equipment.\n \nb. Obtain the services of an experienced selling organization which has proved its effectiveness n selling through conventional drug and camera store outlets, and has demonstrated the necessary versatility to establish and consolidate strong positions in supermarket, mail order, and other less conventional outlets.\n \nc. Reduce total selling expense by spreading such expenditures over a broader product line.\n \nd. Enhance the promotional impact of our film by associating it with an equipment manufacturer of outstanding reputation.\n \n \nTo implement the stated criteria the Photo Products Department made the following observations and recommendations:\nSince our last report to your Committee, considerable attention has again been given to the possibility of Du Pont undertaking this venture alone, without outside affiliation. All such studies, however, indicate that attendant selling, advertising, and promotion expenses would be prohibitive (more than $8MM annually) and that the possibility of achieving profitable volumes in a reasonable time is remote. The early years of such a venture can be expected to involve all the usual hazards imposed on marketing of a non-distinctive product against well entrenched competition. Even assuming reasonable success initially, our inability to cope with anticipated future competitive developments involving film and equipment interdependence would in time inevitably restrict sales. We have again concluded that a properly conceived alliance with a company which meets previously described criteria, particularly in its ability to absorb near-term losses for long-term profit, and which offers a strong position in the equipment field, constitutes the best possible route to success. During this period, negotiations with the Technicolor Corporation, on a possible joint agreement for both marketing and processing our film, have continued. In recent months, however, we have made an intensive study of a joint venture with the Bell & Howell Company of Chicago because they more adequately satisfy the criteria established.\n \n*84 An increasing segment of Bell & Howell’s present business utilizes Eastman Kodak’s Kodachrome Type I as a part of package offers (with a camera, projector and screen) to the amateur market. The growing interdependence of photographic equipment and film makes it necessary for Bell & Howell to eliminate restrictions in their equipment design imposed by virtually complete dependence of films produced primarily by their chief equipment competitor. For this reason, they are intensely interested in an arrangement with Du Pont and are willing to share in the financial losses anticipated during the early years of a joint venture. [Emphasis added.]\n \n* * *\n \nWe now propose to execute a renewable 10-year agreement with Bell & Howell appointing them exclusive distributors for both our color transparency movie and still films and black and white reversal films for the amateur market in the United States and Canada. Bell & Howell have agreed to sell these films under the ‘Du Pont—Bell & Howell’ label and have indicated that they intend to sell the product with processing included in their sales prices.\n \nBell & Howell and Du Pont together would contract with photofinishers for processing film returned by customers. Du Pont would supply continuing technical assistance to processing operations to assure that desired quality levels are maintained.\n \nProfits from sale of film and from processing operations would be divided on the basis of 2/3 to Du Pont and 1/3 to Bell & Howell as described in the proposed contract attached.\n \nBell & Howell would commit for minimum annual sales volumes and would absorb selling, advertising and promotional expenses. If they fail to sell the committed volumes of film, Du Pont would have the right to remove the exclusive distributorship or, if we decided to go out of the business, to cancel the agreement. [Emphasis added.]\n \n \nThe Photo Products Department’s recommendation was presumably approved by the Executive Committee because, on May 24, 1961, plaintiff and Bell & Howell entered into a contract conforming with the department’s representations to the Executive Committee. Thus, the following were among the provisions contained in the contract:\nSubject to the terms and conditions herein set forth, DU PONT hereby appoints and authorizes BELL & HOWELL to act as DU PONT’S exclusive distributor in the United States, its territories and possessions and also as DU PONT’S exclusive distributor in Canada for the sale of DU PONT’S Color Reversal Film and DU PONT’S Black and White Reversal Film to the amateur field, (said Color Reversal Film and Black and White Reversal Film being hereinafter sometimes referred to collectively as ‘Film’). BELL & HOWELL accepts the appointment and agrees to use its best efforts in promoting the sale and distribution of said Film.\n \n* * *\n \nBELL & HOWELL agrees that it will use its best efforts to sell the following minimum quantities of Color Reversal Film:\n \n \n\n\n\n\n1961–1962\t\n \n|2.1 million square feet\n \n|\n1963\t\n \n|3.3 million square feet\n \n|\n1964\t\n \n|4.6 million square feet\n \n|\n1965\t\n \n|7.1 million square feet\n \n|\n1966\t\n \n|9.1 million square feet\n \n|\n1967\t\n \n|11.1 million square feet\n \n|\n1968\t\n \n|14.4 million square feet\n \n|\n1969\t\n \n|18.9 million square feet\n \n|\n1970\t\n \n|22.8 million square feet\n \n|\n\n\n\n\n*85 If during the calendar year 1964 or any calendar year thereafter the number of square feet of Color Reversal Film sold by BELL & HOWELL hereunder is less than the applicable minimums set forth above for that year then DU PONT shall have the right within thirty (30) days after the close of such year and by giving BELL & HOWELL sixty (60) days’ prior written notice, to change BELL & HOWELL’S appointment hereunder from an exclusive basis to a nonexclusive basis for the remainder of the period of this Agreement or to cancel this Agreement. If it should be changed to a nonexclusive basis, no yearly minimums shall thereafter apply.\n* * *\n \nAlthough all advertising, promotion and merchandising in connection with DU PONT’S Film shall be under BELL & HOWELL’S direction and control and shall be at the sole expense of Bell & Howell, nevertheless BELL & HOWELL intends to cooperate and collaborate with DU PONT on such advertising, promotion and merchandising. [Emphasis added.]\n \n* * *\n \nThe prices which shall be paid by BELL & HOWELL to DU PONT for Film purchased hereunder shall be those which shall be fixed from time to time by DU PONT and which shall be in effect at the time orders therefor are received by DU PONT from BELL & HOWELL, which prices BELL & HOWELL shall be notified of by letter, cable or otherwise, subject, however, to such discounts as may be established from time to time during the period of this Agreement * * *. [Emphasis added.]\n \n* * *\n \nAll costs and expenses incurred by BELL & HOWELL in connection with the sale, handling, storage, etc., of DU PONT’S FILM, including any credit risks on sales of the Film made by BELL & HOWELL, shall be assumed by BELL & HOWELL.\n \n* * *\n \nThe initial discount allowed to BELL & HOWELL hereunder shall be either thirty-five percent (35%) or such other discount as the parties hereto may mutually establish. At such time as either BELL & HOWELL’S or DU PONT’S gross annual profit (before Federal income taxes) as disclosed by their respective books of account (including processing profits) from the manufacture or sale of the Film equals a minimum of three hundred thousand dollars ($300,000) for BELL & HOWELL or six hundred thousand dollars ($600,000) for DU PONT then the discount then in effect hereunder shall be adjusted by mutual agreement. At such time as both BELL & HOWELL’S and DU PONT’S gross annual profit (before Federal income taxes) as disclosed by their respective books of account (including processing profits) from the manufacture or sale of the Film equals a minimum of three hundred thousand dollars ($300,000) for BELL & HOWELL and six hundred thousand dollars ($600,000) for DU PONT then the discount applicable thereafter shall be adjusted from time to time so that the gross annual profits of both BELL & HOWELL and DU PONT shall be maintained at approximately a ratio of one (1) to two (2) respectively. In determining BELL & HOWELL’S gross annual profit BELL & HOWELL’S selling expense for Film hereunder shall not exceed, except by mutual consent the following yearly maximums in making such computation:\n \n \n\n\n\n\n1962\t\n \n|1.9 million dollars\n \n|\n1963\t\n \n|2.3 million dollars\n \n|\n1964\t\n \n|2.7 million dollars\n \n|\n1965\t\n \n|3.5 million dollars\n \n|\n1966\t\n \n|4.3 million dollars\n \n|\n1967\t\n \n|5.1 million dollars\n \n|\n1968\t\n \n|6.2 million dollars\n \n|\n1969\t\n \n|7.2 million dollars\n \n|\n1970\t\n \n|8.3 million dollars\n \n|\n\n\n\n\n*86 Because Eastman introduced a new and improved type of Kodachrome film early in 1961 that was the equal in performance of plaintiff’s color film, the above contract was terminated by agreement of the parties before operations under it commenced. The background and content of the contract that was concluded as a result of arm’s-length negotiations between plaintiff and Bell & Howell reveal Bell & Howell’s obligations, responsibilities and risk exposure under the arrangement to have been so materially different from DISA’s position as plaintiff’s marketing agent in Europe as to render the terms of Bell & Howell’s compensation irrelevant for comparative purposes. Among those significant differences are Bell & Howell’s assumption of definitely anticipated losses; its acceptance of specific volume minima on its own sales performance, and its agreement to subordinate its entitlement to a one-third share of total profits, if any, to its ability to contain its marketing expenses within express dollar limits. Each of these elements represent the embodiment of entrepreneurial risk to which DISA was not exposed under its arrangement with plaintiff.\n \n106. Without objection by the defendant, plaintiff placed in evidence a stock registration statement (Form S–1) filed by the Damon Corporation with the Securities and Exchange Commission, as required by law, on November 9, 1972. The nature of the company’s business is described in the statement as follows:\nThe Company is principally engaged in the operation of clinical laboratories and in the development, manufacture and sale of medical instrumentation, veterinary and biological products and school and hobby products. Founded in 1961 as a manufacturer of electronic products, the Company started its school products business in 1965 and has, since 1968, materially diversified its business and products, principally through acquisition.\n \n \nIncluded in the statement is the following:\n \n\n\nJoint Venture with Ortho Pharmaceutical Corporation\nIn May 1970 the Company entered into a joint venture with Ortho Pharmaceutical Corporation (‘Ortho’), a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson. At the present stage, the Company has responsibility for the manufacture of a system for the automated multiple microchemical analysis of blood as well as related disposable specimen collection devices, all developed by the Company. Ortho has responsibility for the marketing of these products on an exclusive worldwide basis. It is anticipated that other medical instruments and related products may be developed in connection with this joint venture, but no assurance of this can be given.\nThis system, designed the AcuChemTM Microanalyzer, performs biochemical profiles on blood collected in conventional specimen collection devices as well as in disposables specially designed for the system. In addition, its microtesting capability permits such profiles, currently available on a routine basis only to adults because of the large volume of blood required by commercially available instrumentation, to be routinely extended for the first time to infants, children and the aged. The specimen collection devices for the system provide additional advantages in that they permit the routine and accurate collection of a blood microsample in a manner requiring less time and skill than are needed to extract blood from a vein.\n \n*87 Under the venture, Ortho will purchase its requirements for these products exclusively from the Company. Essentially, income from the sale of such products will be shared equally by the parties. The development stage in respect of these products has been completed, and the Company has commenced production. As manufacturing is still in an early phase, deliveries will initially be at a relatively low rate. The future success of this venture for the Company will depend upon a number of factors, including the Company’s ability to manufacture efficiently and Ortho’s ability to market the products referred to above. [Emphasis added.]\n \n \nThe record herein contains no other information concerning the details of joint venture referred to above. Thus, the respective capital contributions of the venturers are unknown as are the participants’ specific obligations and responsibilities, including responsibility for operating losses. In addition, the record is silent as to basis on which products and services are to be priced into the venture for purposes of profit determination.\n \n107. In the course of direct examination pertaining to his qualifications as an expert Dr. Stobaugh (finding 102, supra) was asked whether he had ever been personally involved with the pricing of a product made in the United States and sold in the international market. He replied in the affirmative, explaining that when he was employed by the Monsanto Chemical Company he participated in the pricing of a commodity-type item, ethylene dichloride, that for a period of several months during 1961 was being produced domestically in quantities that were approximately one hundred million pounds greater than could be sold on the United States market at a price in keeping with Monsanto’s established domestic pricing structure. In these circumstances the excess production was exported to an Italian company in which Monsanto held a 40 percent minority interest. For these sales the product was specially priced at approximately 10 percent above what Dr. Stobaugh described as Monsanto’s marginal cost. He did not further define the specifics of the pricing arrangement and provided no additional information concerning the financial or other aspects of this single category of transactions.\n \n108. A polychloroprene such as neoprene is conventionally sold by the manufacturer in the form of solid chips. The purchaser blends these chips with numerous other ingredients in a machine that is in the nature of a very high-powered dough mixer. This process produces a plastic substance with a dough-like consistency that is then formed into the configuration of the desired end product, such as a hose, by placing it in a mold. The material is then cured in the mold until it acquires the qualities of resilience and elasticity desired for the intended use of the end product into which it has been formed. Without the addition of a chemical accelerator, this curing process requires several hours. That time is reduced to a matter of 15 or 20 minutes when a suitable accelerating agent is used. It is therefore not commercially feasible to attempt to process any member of the polychloroprene family of elastomers into an end product without the use of an accelerator.\n \n*88 NA–22 is the brand name of the elastomer accelerator manufactured in the United States by plaintiff. In physical appearance it is a very fluffy, light powder that is sold in bulk form, packaged in drum-type containers. The formulation is apparently in the public domain as evidenced by the fact that in the European trading area there are at least three firms, one in England and two on the Continent, that make and market accelerators that are chemically identical to NA–22. In addition, Bayer sells a product that is similar to NA–22 in performance characteristics. The sale of accelerators is normally subject to keen price competition in the marketplace because of the number of supplier alternatives that are available to the buyer.\n \nTransportation costs for accelerators, including NA–22, are relatively high because of the product’s high ratio of volume to weight.\n \nAlthough NA–22 was not a large volume or highly profitable item, DISA was interested in having an accelerator in its product line because of its complementary relationship to polychloroprene items such as neoprene. It served, therefore, both to complete the line and as an indicator to DISA of polychloroprene usage in general.\n \nBecause of the relatively high cost of ocean freight, for reasons previously explained, and because of a 17 percent Common Market import tariff DISA found that plaintiff’s NA–22 was noncompetitive in price with locally produced accelerators. It therefore searched for a source of local production and found it in Rhone-Poulenc, a French chemical firm that had experience in the manufacture of a kindred type of accelerator (one that was carbon disulfidebased) and that was not itself engaged in the polychloroprene business. These attributes, possession of adequate manufacturing know-how and the absence of any competitive threat to DISA’s market for polychloroprene items, made Rhone-Poulenc an ideal source of local manufacture for DISA’s accelerator needs.\n \nOn June 14, 1961, after considerable negotiation, the parties entered into a 1-year supply and distribution contract that was effective July 1, 1961. The contract was drawn in the form of a proposal by Rhone-Poulenc that was duly ratified by DISA. At the expiration of its initial term, the contract automatically continued in force on a year-to-year basis in the absence of a 60-day notice of termination by either party. Subject only to Rhone-Poulenc’s ability to satisfactorily produce, DISA obligated itself to purchase from Rhone-Poulenc its entire requirements of NA–22 for its European, African and Asian markets. In turn, Rhone-Poulenc granted DISA exclusive distribution rights for this product except in France, which territory Rhone-Poulenc apparently reserved for itself. That reservation is implicit in the fact that the contract’s pricing provision applied only to NA–22 sold for export, i. e., sold other than in France. Thus, the contract recited: ‘Keeping in mind the situation you have explained to us from the price stand-point on the different markets, we finally agreed to grant you a special price for the export territories * * *.’ (Emphasis added). No evidence was adduced indicating the extent of the price concession granted by Rhone-Poulenc because of export considerations and its retention of its own domestic market. In any event, the stated price, 8 new francs per kilo, was subject to quarterly revision by mutual agreement.\n \n*89 Plaintiff adduced evidence showing that during the years 1961 through 1966 DISA’s unit cost, f. o. b. Vitry, France, of Rhone-Poulenc’s product was somewhat lower than its cost of plaintiff-produced NA–22, f. a. s. New York. Neither that body of proof nor any other evidence in the record accommodates continuing annual purchases of NA–22 from the plaintiff to DISA’s sole-source procurement obligation to Rhone-Poulenc under the 1961 agreement. However that may be, the evidence that was adduced shows that, primarily because of a lower unit cost of purchased material, DISA realized a larger gross margin on its resale of NA–22 that came from Rhone-Poulenc than on that which it obtained from the plaintiff. No evidence of DISA’s relative distribution or other operating costs pertaining to this product was adduced. It is therefore not impossible to determine the ultimate profitability to DISA of the two sources of supply although, in a general sense, it is reasonable to infer that the French material was the more profitable since the unit-cost data on plaintiff’s material does not even reflect DISA’s landed cost of that material—a cost that would include relatively significant ocean freight and tariff charges, as previously explained.\n \nAside from the facts (1) that NA–22 is a commodity, not a proprietary-type of products and (2) that the volume involved was relatively miniscule, the gross margin that DISA enjoyed on its resale of French-produced NA–22 bears no meaningful or rational relationship to the gross margins that DISA realized on its resale of the large and diverse line of products that it regularly obtained from the plaintiff. The uncontradicted evidence clearly depicts the DISA arrangement with Rhone-Poulenc as a special situation in which it was able to purchase a low-volume, commodity-type item at what the evidence affirmatively describes as a ‘special’ price.\n \n109. Mr. Samuel W. McCune, general sales manager for Du Pont (UK) from September 1957 until mid-1961, testified as a witness for the plaintiff that beginning in 1958 that company sold urea herbicides for both agricultural and industrial use in the United Kingdom. Du Pont (UK) did not manufacture this product, which was covered by British patents owned by the plaintiff. Plaintiff granted Du Pont (UK) a license under these patents and the latter, in turn, granted a sublicense to a British firm, Hickson & Welsh, Ltd., as a part of a contractual arrangement under which Hickson & Welsh manufactured the herbicides for Du Pont (UK). That contract was not offered in evidence and the record discloses no particulars as to its terms other than, as previously noted, the provision for the license of technology. Mr. McCune did testify that Du Pont’s (UK) annual sales of this item amounted initially to approximately $250,000. Over the years, he said, sales volume increased to approximately $600,000. He also testified that Du Pont’s (UK) operative earnings on these sales approximated 30 to 40 percent. Because of the feature of borrowed technology and the overall paucity of detail concerning this arrangement, which Mr. McCune characterized simply as contract manufacturing, no meaningful analogy can be drawn between the commercial relationship of Du Pont (UK), as a herbicide marketer, to Hickson & Welsh, as the manufacturer, and that between DISA and plaintiff.\n \n*90 110. Mr. Edwin B. Hobaugh, sales control manager for the Industrial and Biochemicals Department during the period in suit, appeared as a witness for the plaintiff. Through him, plaintiff adduced evidence concerning the marketing and financial aspects of its resale of the various agricultural and industrial chemicals that it purchased from others. In the case of industrial chemicals such resale volume amounted to $7,123,327 in 1959 on which plaintiff realized pre-tax operative earnings of $515,540, that figure representing 7.24 percent of net sales. For 1960 the resale of such items amounted to $6,590,902 yielding operative earnings of $596,258 or 9.05 percent of net sales. Net resales of agricultural chemicals totaled $2,471,286 in 1959, producing operative earnings of $547,458 or 22.15 percent of net sales. In 1960 such sales amounted to $2,240,199, on which the operative earnings were $484,393 or 21.62 percent.\n \nFor the most part, the agricultural chemicals resold by plaintiff were not patented items. The Industrial and Biochemicals Department contracted annually with manufacturers for an estimated total quantity at a fixed price. A notable exception in both respects was in the case of urea herbicides, designed to kill undesirable broad leaf and woody plants. These herbicides were formulated from trichlorobenzoic acids developed and produced by the Heyden Newport Chemical Company under patents held by that firm. Heyden Newport had no sales organization at the time that it received its patents on these acids. The Industrial and Biochemicals Department approached it with a proposal to market these newly-developed herbicides. Heyden Newport was receptive and an agreement was reached. Under it plaintiff obligated itself to annually purchase minimum quantities of polychlorobenzoic acids as follows: 160,000 pounds in 1958, 375,000 pounds in 1959 and 750,000 pounds in 1960, and in each year thereafter. To the extent that plaintiff failed to purchase those annual quantities, the agreement obligated it for a liquidated damage payment of 16 2/3 cents per pound of deficiency. The agreement contemplated that plaintiff would be reselling the herbicides in liquid form. Plaintiff’s purchase price was fixed at one-half of its net resale price but in no event less than $2.66 per gallon in the case of the Trysben herbicide that it marketed.\n \nIn no instance did the manufacturer of the agricultural chemicals that plaintiff purchased for resale construct its sales price in a manner intended to insulate plaintiff from loss on its marketing activities.\n \nOn the urea herbicide that plaintiff obtained from Heyden Newport and marketed under its own label of ‘Trysben 200’ it realized operative earnings that amounted to 15.06 percent of net sales in 1959 and 12.53 percent in 1960, these returns being on volume of $521,871 and $774,772 in 1959 and 1969, respectively. The fact that these percentages of net profit return compare with gross margin of 44.28 and 48.27 percent for each of the two years, respectively, reflects the intense and expensive selling effort that is entailed in the successful marketing of an agricultural chemical. Mr. Hobaugh thoroughly explained the particulars of those requirements and concluded by observing that they were such as to constitute the marketing of agricultural chemicals as unique within plaintiff’s entire product line. This consideration, coupled with volume and price guarantees involved in plaintiff’s multi-year contract with Heyden Newport, renders its financial experience in the marketing of urea herbicides not comparable with DISA’s marketing activities, as applied to the products with which it was concerned.\n \n*91 Finally, referring to the Industrial and Biochemicals Department’s pre-tax net profit margins of 7.24 and 9.05 percent (realized from gross margins of 12.20 and 13.79 percent, respectively) earned on the resale of industrial chemicals, Mr. Hobaugh characterized such items as ‘nickel and dime’ products, i. e., commodity-type items on which price competition was intense and margins correspondingly thin. He, therefore, expressed the view that the constraints of the marketplace would not have permitted plaintiff to significantly increase the profits that it earned from marketing such items. On the other hand, the record shows that plaintiff allowed DISA a net profit margin of approximately 15 percent for marketing commodity-type items. Finding 92, supra.\n \n111. Although the record discloses one instance, involving a mercury-based fungicide produced by one of the plaintiff’s industrial departments and marketed by another, where profit above direct cost was shared equally by the two participating departments, such an arrangement was employed only in those instances where there was no established market price for the item involved in the interdepartmental transfer. That general policy of pricing products at market price for interdepartmental transfer purposes parallels that employed by plaintiff in the case of transfers to its foreign subsidiaries. Finding 77, supra.\n \nB. Defendant’s Evidence 112. For purposes of this proceeding, an arm’s-length price is deemed to be that price to which two independent, self-interested parties would agree in a transaction free of any type of internal control or constraint.\n \n113. Defendant called two expert witnesses to interpret economic data that it placed in evidence, without significant objection, to support the proposition that had the transactions between plaintiff and DISA during the years in suit occurred instead of between plaintiff and an unrelated party dealing at arm’s length but otherwise possessing all of DISA’s functional attributes, plaintiff would have realized additional income at least equal to that reallocated to it by the Commissioner under the deficiency assessments that plaintiff contests.\n \n114. The first of defendant’s experts was Dr. Charles Berry, a professor of economics at Princeton University, specializing in microeconomics, the observation and analysis of economic behavior in dividual areas of activity such as a particular market or industry, as opposed to the economy as a whole.\n \n115. Given the ultimate objective of determining an arm’s-length level of pricing for the transactions that occurred between plaintiff and DISA, Dr. Berry described the manner in which he proceeded. He explained that for purposes of his inquiry he assumed that in its trading relationship with plaintiff DISA’s functional attributes were precisely as plaintiff had represented them to the Internal Revenue Service. Finding 82, supra. For all financial aspects of the trading relationship he relied on the data supplied by plaintiff in response to defendant’s discovery requests in this action. In a factual setting thus derived, Dr. Berry testified that he was commissioned by the defendant to determine an arm’s-length price for plaintiff’s sales to DISA in accordance with the criteria of the Treasury Regulations promulgated under section 482 of the Revenue Code if he believed that those criteria were applicable to the situation at hand. Dr. Berry acknowledged that in 1962 and 1963 he had served the Treasury Department as a consultant on the means by which arm’s-length prices could be estimated under a variety of circumstances.\n \n*92 116. The relevant portions of the regulations issued under section 482 are as follows:\n§ 1.482–1. Allocation of income and deductions among controlled taxpayers.—(a) Definitions (1) * * *\n \n(6) The term ‘true taxable income’ means, in the case of a controlled taxpayer, the taxable income (or, as the case may be, any item or element affecting taxable income) which would have resulted to the controlled taxpayer, had it in the conduct of its affairs (or, as the case may be, in the particular contract, transaction, arrangement, or other act) dealt with the other member or members of the group at arm’s length. It does not mean the income, the deductions, the credits, the allowances, or the item or element of income, deductions, credits, or allowances, resulting to the controlled taxpayer by reason of the particular contract, transaction, or arrangement, the controlled taxpayer, or the interests controlling it, chose to make (even though such contract, transaction, or arrangement be legally binding upon the parties thereto).\n \n(b) Scope and purpose. (1) The purpose of section 482 is to place a controlled taxpayer on a tax parity with an uncontrolled taxpayer, by determining according to the standard of an uncontrolled taxpayer, the true taxable income from the property and business of a controlled taxpayer. The interests controlling a group of controlled taxpayers are assumed to have complete power to cause each controlled taxpayer so to conduct its affairs that its transactions and accounting records truly reflect the taxable income from the property and business of each of the controlled taxpayers. If, however, this has not been done, and the taxable incomes are thereby understated, the district director shall intervene, and, by making such distributions, apportionments, or allocations as he may deem necessary of gross income, deductions, credits, or allowances, or of any item or element affecting taxable income, between or among the controlled taxpayers constituting the group, shall determine the true taxable income of each controlled taxpayer. The standard to be applied in every case is that of an uncontrolled taxpayer dealing at arm’s length with another uncontrolled taxpayer. [Emphasis added.]\n \n* * *\n \n(d) Method of allocation. (1) The method of allocating, apportioning, or distributing income, deductions, credits, and allowances to be used by the district director in any case, including the form of the adjustments and the character and source of amounts allocated, shall be determined with reference to the substance of the particular transactions or arrangements which result in the avoidance of taxes or the failure to clearly reflect income. The appropriate adjustments may take the form of an increase or decrease in gross income, increase or decrease in deductions (including depreciation), increase or decrease in basis of assets (including inventory), or any other adjustment which may be appropriate under the circumstances. See § 1.482–2 for specific rules relating to methods of allocation in the case of several types of business transactions. [Emphasis added.]\n \n*93 * * *\n \n§ 1.482–2. Determination of taxable income in specific situations.—(a) * * *\n \n(b) Performance of services for another—(1) General rule. Where one member of a group of controlled entities performs marketing, managerial, administrative, technical, or other services for the benefit of, or on behalf of another member of the group without charge, or at a charge which is not equal to an arm’s length charge as defined in subparagraph (3) of this paragraph, the district director may make appropriate allocations to reflect an arm’s length charge for such services.\n \n* * *\n \n(3) Arm’s length charge. For the purpose of this paragraph an arm’s length charge for services rendered shall be the amount which was charged or would have been charged for the same or similar services in independent transactions with or between unrelated parties under similar circumstances considering all relevant facts. However, except in the case of services which are an integral part of the business activity of either the member rendering the services or the member receiving the benefit of the services (as described in subparagraph (7) of this paragraph), the arm’s length charge shall be deemed equal to the costs or deductions incurred with respect to such services by the member or members rendering such services unless the taxpayer establishes a more appropriate charge under the standards set forth in the first sentence of this subparagraph. Where costs or deductions are a factor in applying the provisions of this paragraph adequate books and records must be maintained by taxpayers to permit verification of such costs or deductions by the Internal Revenue Service.\n \n* * *\n \n(e) Sales of tangible property—(1) In general. (i) Where one member of a group of controlled entities (referred to in this paragraph as the ‘seller’) sells or otherwise disposes of tangible property to another member of such group (referred to in this paragraph as the ‘buyer’) at other than an arm’s length price (such a sale being referred to in this paragraph as a ‘controlled sale’), the district director may make appropriate allocations between the seller and the buyer to reflect an arm’s length price for such sale or disposition. An arm’s length price is the price that an unrelated party would have paid under the same circumstances for the property involved in the controlled sale. Since unrelated parties normally sell products at a profit, an arm’s length price normally involves a profit to the seller. [Emphasis added.]\n \n(ii) Subparagraphs (2), (3), and (4) of this paragraph describe three methods of determining an arm’s length price and the standards for applying each method. They are, respectively, the comparable uncontrolled price method, the resale price method, and the cost plus method. If there are comparable uncontrolled sales as defined in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph, the comparable uncontrolled price method must be utilized because it is the method likely to result in the most accurate estimate of an arm’s length price (for the reason that it is based upon the price actually paid by unrelated parties for the same or similar products). If there are no comparable uncontrolled sales, then the resale price method must be utilized if the standards for its application are met hecause it is the method likely to result in the next most accurate estimate in such instances (for the reason that, in such instances, the arm’s length price determined under such method is based more directly upon actual arm’s length transactions than is the cost plus method). A typical situation where the resale price method may be required is where a manufacturer sells products to a related distributor which, without further processing, resells the products in uncontrolled transactions. If all the standards for the mandatory application of the resale price method are not satisfied, then, as provided in subparagraph (3)(iii) of this paragraph, either that method or the cost plus method may be used, depending upon which method is more feasible and is likely to result in a more accurate estimate of an arm’s length price. A typical situation where the cost plus method may be appropriate is where a manufacturer sells products to a related entity which performs substantial manufacturing, assembly, or other processing of the product or adds significant value by reason of its utilization of its intangible property prior to resale in uncontrolled transactions. [Emphasis added.]\n \n*94 (iii) Where the standards for applying one of the three methods of pricing described in subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph are met, such method must, for the purposes of this paragraph, be utilized unless the taxpayer can establish that, considering all the facts and circumstances, some method of pricing other than those described in subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph is clearly more appropriate. Where none of the three methods of pricing described in subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph can reasonably be applied under the facts and circumstances as they exist in a particular case, some appropriate method of pricing other than those described in subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph, or variations on such methods, can be used. [Emphasis added.]\n \n* * *\n \n(2) Comparable uncontrolled price method. (i) Under the method of pricing described as the ‘comparable uncontrolled price method’, the arm’s length price of a controlled sale is equal to the price paid in comparable uncontrolled sales, adjusted as provided in subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph.\n \n(ii) ‘Uncontrolled sales’ are sales in which the seller and the buyers are not members of the same controlled group. These include (a) sales made by a member of the controlled group to an unrelated party, (b) sales made to a member of the controlled group by an unrelated party, and (c) sales made in which the parties are not members of the controlled group and are not related to each other. However, uncontrolled sales do not include sales at unrealistic prices, as for example where a member makes uncontrolled sales in small quantities at a price designed to justify a nonarm’s length price on a large volume of controlled sales. Uncontrolled sales are considered comparable to controlled sales if the physical property and circumstances involved in the uncontrolled sales are identical to the physical property and circumstances involved in the controlled sales, or if such properties and circumstances are so nearly identical that any differences either have no effect on price, or such differences can be reflected by a reasonable number of adjustments to the price of uncontrolled sales. For this purpose, differences can be reflected by adjusting prices only where such differences have a definite and reasonably ascertainable effect on price. If the differences can be reflected by such adjustment, then the price of the uncontrolled sale as adjusted constitutes the comparable uncontrolled sale price. Some of the differences which may affect the price of property are differences in the quality of the product, terms of sale, intangible property associated with the sale, time of sale, and the level of the market and the geographic market in which the sale takes place. Whether and to what extent differences in the various properties and circumstances affect price, and whether differences render sales non-comparable, depends upon the particular circumstances and property involved * * *.\n \n* * *\n \n*95 (3) Resale price method. (i) Under the pricing method described as the ‘resale price method’, the arm’s length price of a controlled sale is equal to the applicable resale price (as defined in subdivision (iv) or (v) of this subparagraph), reduced by an appropriate markup, and adjusted as provided in subdivision (ix) of this subparagraph. An appropriate markup is computed by multiplying the applicable resale price by the appropriate markup percentage as defined in subdivision (vi) of this subparagraph. Thus, where one member of a group of controlled entities sells property to another member which resells the property in uncontrolled sales, if the applicable resale price of the property involved in the controlled sale is $100 and the appropriate markup percentage for resales by the buyer is 20 percent, the arm’s length price of the controlled sale is $80 ($100 minus 20 percent x $100), adjusted as provided in subdivision (ix) of this subparagraph. [Emphasis added.]\n \n(ii) The resale price method must be used to compute an arm’s length price of a controlled sale if all the following circumstances exist:\n \n(a) There are no comparable uncontrolled sales as defined in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph.\n \n(b) An applicable resale price, as defined in subdivision (iv) or (v) of this subparagraph, is available with respect to resales made within a reasonable time before or after the time of the controlled sale.\n \n(c) The buyer (reseller) has not added more than an insubstantial amount to the value of the property by physically altering the product before resale. For this purpose packaging, repacking, labeling, or minor assembly of property does not constitute physical alteration.\n \n(d) The buyer (reseller) has not added more than an insubstantial amount to the value of the property by the use of intangible property. See § 1.482–2(d)(3) for the definition of intangible property. [Emphasis added.]\n \n(iii) Notwithstanding the fact that one or both of the requirements of subdivision (ii)(c) or (d) of this subparagraph may not be met, the resale price method may be used if such method is more feasible and is likely to result in a more accurate determination of an arm’s-length price than the use of the cost plus method. Thus, even though one of the requirements of such subdivision is not satisfied, the resale price method may nevertheless be more appropriate than the cost plus method because the computations and evaluations required under the former method may be fewer and easier to make than under the latter method. In general, the resale price method is more appropriate when the functions performed by the seller are more extensive and more difficult to evaluate than the functions performed by the buyer (reseller). * * *. [Emphasis added.]\n \n* * *\n \n(iv) For the purposes of this subparagraph the ‘applicable resale price’ is the price at which it is anticipated that property purchased in the controlled sale will be resold by the buyer in an uncontrolled sale. The ‘applicable resale price’ will generally be equal to either the price at which current resales of the same property are being made or the resale price of the particular item of property involved. [Emphasis added.]\n \n*96 (v) Where the property purchased in the controlled sale is resold in another controlled sale, the ‘applicable resale price’ is the price at which such property is finally resold in an uncontrolled sale, providing that the series of sales as a whole meets all the requirements of subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph or that the resale price method is used pursuant to subdivision (iii) of this subparagraph. In such case, the determination of the appropriate markup percentage shall take into account the function or functions performed by all members of the group participating in the series of sales and resales. Thus, if X sells a product to Y in a controlled sale, Y sells the product to Z in a controlled sale, and Z sells the product in an uncontrolled sale, the resale price method must be used if Y and Z together have not added more than an insubstantial amount to the value of the product through physical alteration or the application of intangible property, and the final resale occurs within a reasonable time of the sale from X to Y. In such case, the applicable resale price is the price at which Z sells the product in the uncontrolled sale, and the appropriate markup percentage shall take into account the functions performed by both Y and Z.\n \n(vi) For the purposes of this subparagraph, the appropriate markup percentage is equal to the percentage of gross profit (expressed as a percentage of sales) earned by the buyer (reseller) or another party on the resale of property which is both purchased and resold in an uncontrolled transaction, which resale is most similar to the applicable resale of the property involved in the controlled sale. The following are the most important characteristics to be considered in determining the similarity of resales:\n \n(a) The type of property in the sales. For example: machine tools, men’s furnishings, small household appliances.\n \n(b) The functions performed by the reseller with respect to the property. For example: packaging, labeling, delivering, maintenance of inventory, minor assembly, advertising, selling at wholesale, selling at retail, billing, maintenance of accounts receivable, and servicing.\n \n(c) The effect on price of any intangible property utilized by the reseller in connection with the property resold. For example: patents, trademarks, trade names.\n \n(d) The geographic market in which the functions are performed by the reseller.\n \nIn general, the similarity to be sought relates to the probable effect upon the markup percentage of any differences in such characteristics between the uncontrolled purchases and resales on the one hand and the controlled purchases and resales on the other hand. Thus, close physical similarity of the property involved in the sales compared is not required under the resale price method since a lack of close physical similarity is not necessarily indicative of dissimilar markup percentages. [Emphasis added.]\n \n* * *\n \n(ix) In determining an arm’s length price appropriate adjustment must be made to reflect any material differences between the uncontrolled purchases and resales used as the basis for the calculation of the appropriate markup percentage and the resales of property involved in the controlled sale. The differences referred to in this subdivision are those differences in functions or circumstances which have a definite and reasonably ascertainable effect on price. The principles of this subdivision may be illustrated by the following example:\n \n*97 Example. Assume that X and Y are members of the same group of controlled entities and that Y purchases electric mixers from X and electric toasters from uncontrolled entities. Y performs substantially similar functions with respect to resales of both the mixers and the toasters, except that it does not warrant the toasters, but does provide a 90-day warranty for the mixers. Y normally earns a gross profit on toasters of 20 percent of gross selling price. The 20-percent gross profit on the resale of toasters is an appropriate markup percentage, but the price of the controlled sale computed with reference to such rate must be adjusted to reflect the difference in terms (the warranty). [Emphasis added.]\n \n(4) Cost plus method. (i) Under the pricing method described as the ‘cost plus method’, the arm’s length price of a controlled sale of property shall be computed by adding to the cost of producing such property (as computed in subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph), an amount which is equal to such cost multiplied by the appropriate gross profit percentage (as computed in subdivision (iii) of this subparagraph), plus or minus any adjustments as provided in subdivision (v) of this subparagraph.\n \n \n117. Referring to the essentially undisputed evidence showing (1) that the domestically-produced products that plaintiff sold DISA were basically the same as those that it sold in the United States and to independent foreign buyers, and (2) that the prices charged DISA were significantly lower (some 20–25 percent) than the fundamentally equivalent prices that it charged its United States and independent overseas customers (the equivalence indicating an absence of price discrimination favoring exports generally), Dr. Berry posited that if the differential in DISA’s favor were attributable to considerations of an arm’s length nature it would necessarily reflect the approximate value of marketing services and assistance that plaintiff received from DISA but not from the other categories of buyers. In these circumstances Dr. Berry, purporting to proceed in accordance with the directives of the Treasury Regulations, described his basic approach as that of arriving at an arm’s-length price for plaintiff’s sales to DISA by subtracting from plaintiff’s prices to independent foreign customers the arm’s-length price, determined by the comparable uncontrolled price method as prescribed by section 1.482–2(e)(2) of the Treasury Regulations (finding 116, supra), of the marketing services that DISA was rendering plaintiff in conjunction with the products that it purchased from plaintiff. He also characterized this approach as conforming with the provisions of section 1.482–2(e)(3) of the Treasury Regulations, delineating the so-called resale price method. Dr. Berry did not undertake, and defendant has not otherwise undertaken to relate the procedures that he employed to the specific language of either of the referenced provisions of the regulations. As to the comparable uncontrolled price method, the parties agree that DISA has no free market counterpart. The record is clearly to that effect. Moreover, by its terms, the comparable uncontrolled price method is concerned with the price at which a controlled entity ‘sells or otherwise disposes of tangible property,’ not with the price at which it renders marketing services to another, a situation apparently covered by another portion of the regulations to which the defendant has not even referred, viz, section 1.482–2(b), finding 116, supra.\n \n*98 118. To approximate an arm’s-length price for the services that DISA rendered plaintiff, Dr. Berry looked to the types of independent businesses that collectively, although not individually, engage regularly in the types of activity that plaintiff attributed to DISA. He concluded that DISA performed no functions that were beyond the overall spectrum of activity represented by management consulting firms, advertising agencies and distributors operating in the United States. The evidence in this case supports that conclusion.\n \nIndependent of Dr. Berry, defendant caused a random compilation to be made of publicly-held firms believed to fall in any of the three categories mentioned. Reference was then made to the public files of the Securities and Exchange Commission (S. E. C.) in an attempt to secure pertinent financial and operational data relative to these companies, as contained in their respective annual reports, Form 10K, filed with the Commission as required by law. See section 13 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, ch. 404, 48 Stat. 881, 894. Some firms were discarded because their 10K filings disclosed that in fact their businesses did not fall predominantly within one of the three categories. Most were eliminated because they had not been subject to Form 10K filing requirements for a sufficient period of time to constitute a representative period. With exclusions made only for these reasons, the roster was reduced to 32 companies that included most, if not all of the most well-known and successful in their field. There were six management consulting companies. They were: Bolt Baranek and Newman, Inc.; Booze Allen & Hamilton, Inc.; Comprehensive Designers, Inc.; Arthur D. Little, Inc.; Mathematica, Inc.; and Planning Research Corp. There were five advertising agencies. They were: Doyle Dane Bernbach, Inc.; Foote, Cone & Belding Communications, Inc.; Ogilvy & Mather International, Inc.; J. Walter Thompson Co.; and Wells, Rich & Greene, Inc. There were 21 distributors. They were: Aceto Chemical Co., Inc.; AIC Photo, Inc.; Automated Marketing Systems, Inc.; Bergen Brunswig Corp.; Empress International Ltd.; ESD Co.; General Research Corp.; Interphoto Corp.; Ketchum Industries, Inc.; Lloyd’s Electronics, Inc.; Morse Electro Products Corp.; N. M. S. Industries, Inc.; Owens, Minor & Bodeker, Inc.; Soundesign Corp.; Spectro Industries, Inc.; Telecor, Inc.; UNA Corp.; R. V. Weatherford Co.; Zale Corp.; Superscope, Inc.; and Foremost-McKesson, Inc. Relevant portions of these firms’ annual filings with the S. E. C., including profit and loss statements, balance sheets, and descriptive statements of business operations for the 5-year period of 1967 through 1971 (except for seven instances in which the observation period was 1968–1972 and two where the period was less than 5 years) were admitted in evidence.\n \nBecause it is true that normally what a business spends to provide services is a reasonable indication of the magnitude of those services and because the only determinate element germane to an evaluation of the arm’s-length worth of the services that DISA rendered plaintiff were the total costs that DISA incurred to generate the services, Dr. Berry selected cost as the beginning point for comparing DISA with the 32 independent companies that, collectively, sold DISA’s type of services in the free market.\n \n*99 Reflecting the fact that a profit-making organization selling services ordinarily expects to receive more for those services than its cost of producing them, a comparison of operating cost with revenue received for services rendered by the 32 companies shows a relatively stable relationship between the two—both within the three separate categories of business and for the group as a whole.\n \n119. In each of the 5 years for which the operating data of the six management consulting organizations were observed, those companies achieved the following ratios of revenue from services (i. e., net billings to customers) to the cost of providing those services (i. e., total operating cost), expressed as a percentage (revenue as a percentage of operating cost):\n \n\n\n\n\nRevenue to Cost\n \n|Company-years\n \n|\n0–99%\n \n|2\n \n|\n100–109%\n \n|15\n \n|\n110–119%\n \n|13\n \n|\nTotal\n \n|30\n \n|\n\n\n\n\nOn the average, the six consulting companies were able to sell their services for 108.3 percent of what it cost them to produce the services.\n \nThe 5-year average ratio of revenue to cost for each of the companies ranged from a low of 103.6 percent to a high of 112.5 percent.\n \n120. With the amounts representing cost of advertising space eliminated both from net billings to customers (leaving a balance approximating the standard agency commission of 15 percent of media cost) and from total operating expense, the five advertising agencies achieved the following percentage proportion of income from services to the cost of providing the services over a period of the 25 company-years for which data were available:\n \n\n\n\n\nRevenue to Cost\n \n|Company-years\n \n|\n100–109%\t\n \n|1\n \n|\n110–119%\t\n \n|15\n \n|\n120–129%\t\n \n|3\n \n|\n130–139%\t\n \n|3\n \n|\n140–149%\t\n \n|1\n \n|\n150–150%\t\n \n|1\n \n|\n190–199%\t\n \n|1\n \n|\nTotal\t\n \n|25\n \n|\n\n\n\n\nOn the average the advertising agencies were able to sell their services for 123.9% of what it cost them to generate those services, that as compared with the comparable figure of 108.3% for the management consulting firms. Finding 119, supra.\n \n121. For the distributors there were 101 company-years of operating experience available. Treating income from services as gross profit (net sales less cost of goods sold) and the cost of such services as total operating expenses (i. e., all costs other than the cost of merchandise purchased for resale) the annual percentage relationship of service income to expense for the 21 distributors is classified as follows:\n \n\n\n\n\nRevenue to Cost\n \n|Company-years\n \n|\n0–99%\n \n|1\n \n|\n100–109%\n \n|4\n \n|\n110–119%\n \n|17\n \n|\n120–129%\n \n|27\n \n|\n130–139%\n \n|18\n \n|\n140–149%\n \n|13\n \n|\n150–159%\n \n|6\n \n|\n160–169%\n \n|4\n \n|\n170–179%\n \n|5\n \n|\n180–189%\n \n|2\n \n|\n190–199%\n \n|2\n \n|\n200–209%\n \n|1\n \n|\n250–259%\n \n|1\n \n|\nTotal\n \n|101\n \n|\n\n\n\n\n*100 As a group the 21 distributors achieved an average return for services rendered of 129.3 percent of the total cost of providing those services, this as contrasted with 123.9 percent for advertising agencies and 108.3 percent for management consulting firms.\n \nFor the 2 years in suit DISA’s percentage ratio of gross income (i. e., net sales less cost of goods sold) to total operating expense, before and after the Commissioner’s reallocation of income, was as follows:\n \n\n\n\n\n|Before Reallocation\n \n|After Reallocation\n \n|\n1959\t\n \n|281.5%\n \n|108.6%\n \n|\n1960\t\n \n|397.1%\n \n|179.3%\n \n|\n\n\n\n\nAlthough DISA was organized in February 1959, it did not become operational until September 1 of that year. Findings 69, 79, supra. Prior to September 1, it incurred start-up expenses totaling $275,863, as follows:\n \n\n\n\n\nSalaries\t\n \n|$133,064\n \n|\nStationery & printing\t\n \n|14,066\n \n|\nTravel expense\t\n \n|56,836\n \n|\nEmployees’ housing\t\n \n|6,143\n \n|\nOrganization expense\t\n \n|5,708\n \n|\nOffice rent\t\n \n|5,391\n \n|\nSchool allowance\t\n \n|5,021\n \n|\nMiscellaneous categories (less than $5,000 each)\t\n \n|49,634\n \n|\n\n\n\n\nThe 1959 pre-reallocation ratio of revenue to cost set forth above is based on the inclusion of all of the above start-up expenses in total operating cost. Exclusive of those expenses the ratio would be over 336 percent instead of 281.5 percent. Elimination of the same expenses for purposes of the 1959 post-reallocation ratio would have a comparable effect.\n \n122. Although, as indicated above, the prices at which plaintiff sold goods to DISA provided the latter with gross margins that, when viewed in relation to what it cost to provide the marketing services that DISA performed for plaintiff’s benefit, permitted DISA to enjoy levels of profitability far beyond anything achieved by the independent operators whose financial results were analyzed by Dr. Berry. The evidence shows that the wide discrepancy in comparative profitability is attributable to expense rather than gross margin considerations.\n \nOf the three categories of businesses represented in the data interpreted by Dr. Berry, the distributors achieved the highest level of return for each dollar of operating cost incurred.\n \n*101 123. It is reasonable to conclude from the evidence that of the three types of service-oriented businesses evaluated by Dr. Berry the distributors (aside from attributes of entrepreneurship) are most functionally comparable to DISA, not only because of a basic similarity in the types of marketing services rendered by each but because, like DISA, the distributors obtained the funds with which to provide those services from the difference between the price at which they purchased goods from a manufacturer and that at which they were able to resell those goods. That difference, or gross margin, did not differ materially as between DISA and the independent distributors. In fact, DISA’s average gross margin of 26 percent of resale price during the years in suit is well within the range of gross margins realized by the distributors observed by Dr. Berry. Finding 88, supra.\n \nThe evidence shows that DISA so dramatically exceeded the profitability of the independent distributor community, even though it operated on a comparable gross margin, because to earn the dollars represented by that margin it did not have to spend nearly so many dollars to provide service and otherwise operate its business as did the distributors who bought and sold their products and services at prices determined by free market forces.\n \n124. For the significance of gross margin comparability in the determination of an arm’s-length price under the resale price method prescribed by the Treasury Regulations, see section 1.482–2(e)(3)(vi) of those regulations. Section 1.482–2(e)(3)(ix) of the regulations direct that a price once determined under the resale price method by gross margin comparability must be adjusted to take account of any differences between the compared entities in functions or circumstances that have a definite and reasonably ascertainable effect on price.\n \nEvidence offered by plaintiff’s own experts in this case specifically identifies exposure to such entrepreneurial risks as the risk of operating loss as a circumstance that has a definite and reasonably ascertainable effect on price. Findings 102, 103, supra.\n \nIt is not suggested and does not appear that any of the 32 entities evaluated by Dr. Berry bore any less than all of the risks of loss or failure normally associated with the conduct of an independent, profit-making enterprise. By virtue of its pricing and other arrangements with plaintiff, DISA was not subject to those risks. Findings 78–80, 82, 84, supra.\n \n125. As its second expert witness defendant called Dr. Irving Plotkin, an econometrician, i.e., a person sufficiently skilled in the disciplines of economics, mathematics and statistics, to be able to employ mathematics and statistics to reliably test the real-world validity of economic theory.\n \n126. The exercise that Dr. Plotkin performed in this case was not represented by him as a method of pricing the goods that plaintiff sold DISA. [Section 1.482–2(e)(iii), Treasury Regulations under the Internal Revenue Code of 1954.] Its evident purpose, rather, was to determine whether the degree of profitability that DISA achieved operating under the constraints, including the pricing structure, imposed by the plaintiff was within the zone of profit normalcy that it would have achieved had it operated, instead, subject only to the competitive forces to which virtually all uncontrolled enterprises are exposed in the marketplace.\n \n*102 127. At the outset, Dr. Plotkin identified the related competitive forces that operate to limit the range of profitability of uncontrolled enterprise and then proceeded to prove both their existence and effect by analyzing an impressive body of unrefuted evidence introduced through him.\n \n128. Dr. Plotkin explained that, as the means by which assets necessary to generate income are acquired, capital is indispensable to the functioning of virtually all profit-making enterprises. Since capital gravitates to the uses that will yield the highest rate of return to the source that provides it, whether that source be a lender or an investor, all businesses are in what amounts to continuing competition for the capital that their financial success requires. Relative stability in that competition is created by the flow of salable goods or services produced by the assets represented by capital, once committed. Such production tends to balance supply with demand in the marketplace, thereby affecting profitability for the producer and, consequently, the rate of return that he is able to project to potential creditors or investors from the capital market.\n \n129. As a subsidiary proposition, Dr. Plotkin submitted that the price, called rate of return, that a business is able to pay for each dollar of capital that it has attracted is determined by the combination of the number of dollars of sales revenue that the business is able to generate per dollar of capital employed, called turnover, and the portion of each such dollar of sales that represents profit, that relative portion known as margin. In isolation, neither of these factors determine a business’ profit. Moreover, when permitted to operate in an uncontrolled environment, the forces of supply and demand impose both a limit and an inverse relationship on these two factors. Thus, while a low unit price that reflects a correspondingly low margin tends to increase unit sales, and consequently rate of turnover, progressive increases in that price tend proportionately to inhibit demand, thereby reducing unit sales and consequently rate of turnover.\n \n130. To prove the validity of his assertions Dr. Plotkin referred to an extensive body of financial data compiled in the regular course of its business by Standard and Poor’s, a leading United States publisher of business statistics. Such statistics typically include basic balance sheet and profit and loss information pertaining to publicly-held businesses. As such, those businesses are required by law and/or convention to regularly report information of that type to interested regulatory bodies such as the Securities and Exchange Commission and to the exchanges on which their shares are traded. It is from those sources that Standard and Poor’s gathers the information that it publishes. The information in this instance was recorded by Standard and Poor’s on a computer tape. For the 1,133 publicly-owned companies for which the desired information was available on an annual basis for each of the years 1960 through 1969 the computerized data included all information necessary to determine each company’s turnover, margin and return on total capital employed, viz, the balance sheet items of long-term debt, debt in current liabilities (other than trade payables), preferred stock outstanding and common stock equity and the profit and loss items of net sales, fixed charges (i. e., interest paid) and after-tax net income. Except for the deliberate exclusion of public utilities (whose rate-of-return is determined by governmental regulation rather than by the forces of competition) and of such purely financial-type institutions as banks and insurance companies (who earn money by the use of it as such rather than as a means of financing the production and sale of commercial goods and services), the only constraint on inclusion in the roster of companies forming the data base was the availability to Standard and Poor’s of the seven items of data, previously described, for the full 10-year observation period.\n \n*103 131. The 1,133 companies included in the data base accounted for at least 80 percent of all private, nonfinancial commercial activity in the United States during the period to which the data relates.\n \nThe broad diversity of functional activity exemplified by the 1,133 companies is attested by the fact that within their ranks no less than 188 separate industries, as recognized by the Standard Industrial Classification index promulgated by the U. S. Department of Commerce, are represented. Except for a few instances where trading is over-the-counter, all companies’ shares are regularly traded on either the New York or American Stock Exchanges. The most prominent firms in each of the industries represented are included. The roster runs the gamut from such basic industries as mineral extraction to retail service establishments and includes a great many applications of manufacturing, wholesaling and retailing. Accordingly, businesses representing virtually all degrees of capital intensity are included in the data universe.\n \nBecause all financial data collated by Standard and Poor’s was reported by the companies on a consolidated basis, the effect of transactions with controlled entities was automatically eliminated. The data therefore reflect only the results of dealings with independent third parties.\n \nIn sum, it is concluded that the data base is fairly representative of the financial performance of the uncontrolled, non-financial segment of private enterprise in the United States economy as a whole.\n \n132. Total capital employed in a business is the sum of common and preferred stock equity plus long-term and other debt (exclusive of trade credit such as accounts payable). As a standard for relative profitability comparisons between a variety of businesses, the base of total capital is preferable to that of only net worth (i. e., the sum of common and preferred equity) because rate-of-return differences owing purely to the fortuity of how a business elects to finance itself (debt or equity) are eliminated.\n \n133. The measure of the return that is to be contrasted with the total capital base in order to determine a meaningful rate-of-return is after-tax net income plus interest paid. Since net income that must be paid out for taxes is not available to the owners of the business, it is proper that only income remaining after payment of all expenses of doing business, including taxes, be deemed to constitute return to them. Moreover, whereas the return to equity interests is in the nature of residual earnings, the return to creditors (suppliers of debt capital) is the interest that is paid them. Since that interest has been deducted in arriving at the net income figure, it must be restored when the object is quantification of the return to all suppliers of capital, both debt and equity.\n \n134. For the aggregate of the 1,133 companies observed by Dr. Plotkin, the following table sets forth both the annual and 10-year averages of margin, turnover and rate-of-return on total capital employed, together with the annual and 10-year aggregate dollar values of the ingredients on which those averages are based (findings 129, 132, supra):\n \n\n\n\n\n(Dollar Amounts are Expressed in Billions)\n \n|\n|1969\n \n|1968\n \n|1967\n \n|1966\n \n|1965\n \n|1964\n \n|\nLong term debt\t\n \n|$116.31\n \n|$102.65\n \n|$ 87.45\n \n|$ 71.39\n \n|$ 59.91\n \n|$ 52.57\n \n|\nDebt in current liabilities\t\n \n|$ 34.12\n \n|$ 25.73\n \n|$ 21.78\n \n|$ 18.30\n \n|$ 13.73\n \n|$ 10.72\n \n|\nPreferred stock outstanding\t\n \n|$ 16.43\n \n|$ 14.33\n \n|$ 11.14\n \n|$ 7.51\n \n|$ 6.36\n \n|$ 5.41\n \n|\nCommon equity\t\n \n|$264.27\n \n|$246.58\n \n|$228.97\n \n|$213.60\n \n|$196.49\n \n|$182.23\n \n|\nNet sales\t\n \n|$572.10\n \n|$520.57\n \n|$457.93\n \n|$423.24\n \n|$378.56\n \n|$338.84\n \n|\nFixed charges\t\n \n|$ 8.36\n \n|$ 6.51\n \n|$ 5.34\n \n|$ 4.15\n \n|$ 3.31\n \n|$ 2.86\n \n|\nNet income\t\n \n|$ 31.53\n \n|$ 30.78\n \n|$ 27.38\n \n|$ 27.89\n \n|$ 25.36\n \n|$ 22.07\n \n|\nRate-of-return on total capital employed\t\n \n|9.72%\n \n|10.10%\n \n|9.91%\n \n|10.91%\n \n|10.87%\n \n|10.29%\n \n|\nTurnover\t\n \n|1.395\n \n|1.410\n \n|1.387\n \n|1.441\n \n|1.436\n \n|1.399\n \n|\nMargin\t\n \n|6.97%\n \n|7.16%\n \n|7.15%\n \n|7.57%\n \n|7.57%\n \n|7.36%\n \n|\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Dollar Amounts are Expressed in Billions)\n \n|\n \n|1963\n \n|1962\n \n|1961\n \n|1960\n \n|10-year Value\n \n|\nLong term debt\t\n \n|$ 48.74\n \n|$ 46.91\n \n|$ 43.43\n \n|$ 40.91\n \n|$ 670.27\n \n|\nDebt in current liabilities\t\n \n|$ 9.66\n \n|$ 9.19\n \n|$ 8.06\n \n|$ 7.54\n \n|$ 158.83\n \n|\nPreferred stock outstanding\t\n \n|$ 5.44\n \n|$ 5.19\n \n|$ 5.04\n \n|$ 4.78\n \n|$ 81.64\n \n|\nCommon equity\t\n \n|$169.56\n \n|$160.47\n \n|$152.73\n \n|$144.00\n \n|$1958.90\n \n|\nNet sales\t\n \n|$311.27\n \n|$289.91\n \n|$265.82\n \n|$258.37\n \n|$3816.61\n \n|\nFixed charges\t\n \n|$ 2.64\n \n|$ 2.48\n \n|$ 2.24\n \n|$ 2.07\n \n|$ 39.97\n \n|\nNet income\t\n \n|$ 19.18\n \n|$ 17.28\n \n|$ 15.22\n \n|$ 15.06\n \n|$ 231.75\n \n|\nRate-of-return on total capital employed\t\n \n|9.59%\n \n|9.17%\n \n|8.59%\n \n| \n|9.47%\n \n|\nTurnover\t\n \n|1.368\n \n|1.345\n \n|1.308\n \n| \n|1.330\n \n|\nMargin\t\n \n|7.01%\n \n|6.82%\n \n|6.57%\n \n| \n|7.12%\n \n|\n\n\n\n\n*104 135.

A graphic depiction of the respective margins and rates of turnover achieved by each of the 1,133 companies on both as annual and a 10-year average basis forms a distinct pattern of relatively narrow limits within which the margin and turnover results of virtually all firms are contained. Within that pattern those values are shown to bear an inverse relationship to each other, viz, the higher the margin, the lower the rate of turnover and vice versa. A comparison of DISA’s pre-reallocation margin and turnover results for the years in suit (finding 135, supra) with this body of data shows that while, in isolation, neither of these DISA values is atypical, the margin and turnover combinations (the product of the two constituting rate-of-return) recorded by DISA are totally unprecedented as contrasted with the performance of the 1,133 companies.\n \n139. As reflected by the following table, the average rate-of-return on total capital employed, margin and rate of turnover achieved by the 32 companies observed by Dr. Berry (finding 118, supra) conforms closely with the average results realized by the 1,133 companies, as reflected in finding 134 supra:\n \n\n\n\n\n \n|Margins, Rates of Turnover and Rates-of-Return for 32 Companies\n \n|\n \n|Margin—%\n \n|Various Turnover\n \n|Years to 1971 Rate-of-Return—%\n \n|Years\n \n|\nAceto Chemical Company (D)*\t\n \n|3.67\n \n|2.82\n \n|10.34\n \n|70–71\n \n|\nAIC Photo, Inc.
