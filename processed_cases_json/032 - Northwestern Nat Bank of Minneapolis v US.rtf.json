    "Background": "\n\n\n\n1976 WL 1016\nUnited States District Court; D. Minnesota, Fourth Division.\nNorthwestern National Bank of Minneapolis, Plaintiff\nv.\nUnited States of America, Defendant.\n4-73 Civ. 268\n|\n4/30/76\n\n\nLORD, District Judge.\n\nOrder Granting Judgment in Favor of the Defendant\n*1 This matter is now before the Court for judgment upon stipulated facts.\n \nThis action is brought under 28 U. S. C. § 1346(a)(1) to recover alleged overpayments of income taxes made by the plaintiff for the taxable year 1967 on January 4, 1973, and for the taxable year 1968 on December 27, 1972. As required by Section 7422(a) of the Internal Revenue Code (Code), claims for refund of such overpayments on the ground asserted in the action were filed on February 12, 1973. The claims were disallowed on March 21, 1973, and, as authorized by Section 6532(a) of the Code, this action was begun on May 21, 1973.\n \nThe question presented is whether the Commissioner of Internal Revenue (Commissioner) abused the discretion given to him by Section 482 of the Code by reallocating a charitable deduction claimed by plaintiff to plaintiff’s wholly-owned subsidiary. The charitable contribution was made in 1966 in the form of a dividend declaration of the stock from the subsidiary to plaintiff and the transfer of the stock by plaintiff to charity three days later.\n \nThe effect of the Commissioner’s allocation of the deduction to plaintiff’s subsidiary instead of plaintiff is that the charitable contributions could not be taken into account in computing the amount by which plaintiff’s charitable contributions in 1966 exceeded the allowable percentage limitations on their deductibility for purposes of carryover of such excess to, and deduction in, each of the taxable years 1967 and 1968.\n \nFor the reasons herein discussed, this Court has determined that Judgment based upon the stipulated facts must be entered in favor of the United States.\nI. Facts\n \nThe plaintiff, Northwestern National Bank (Bank) is a Minneapolis Bank Corporation which wholly owns Northwestern Bank Building Co. (Bank Building Co.). (Stip. par. 1, 4 and 7). Bank Building Co. in turn owned the asset in question, approximately 10% (10,000 shares) of stock in The Center, Inc. (Center, Inc.). Center, Inc. owned a valuable building complex known as Northstar Center. (Stip. par. 8 and 9.)\n \nOn December 16, 1965, a committee of the Bank’s Board of Directors informed the Board that earlier that day the Directors of Center, Inc. had discussed the possible sale of Northstar Center. In the event of such a sale, the stock of Center, Inc. held by the Bank Building Co. would be of considerable value. The Bank’s Board of Directors unanimously authorized the Bank’s management to proceed with negotiations for the sale of the Bank Building Co.’s stock investment in Center, Inc. (Stip. par. 10 and 11, Exs. A and B.)\n \nOn December 22, the Bank’s controller, Mr. Moorehead, addressed a memorandum to its president, Mr. Dissmeyer, suggesting that legal counsel be consulted and that a review of the “possible effects” of the proposed sale of Center, Inc. stock had led him to “see three ways this could be handled and several legal questions.” The three noted alternatives were said to be (1) sale of the Center, Inc. stock by the Bank building Co., (2) contribution of the stock by the Bank Building Co. to the Northwestern Foundation (Foundation), a Bank-sponsored Minnesota non-profit corporation which qualifies for the receiving of “charitable contributions” as defined in § 170(3)(2) of the Code, followed by sale of the stock by the Foundation, and (3) transfer of the stock by the Bank Building Co. to the Bank as a dividend, followed by the Bank’s contribution of the stock to and its sale by, the Foundation. (Emphasis added.) (Stip. par. 12, Ex. C.)\n \n*2 Alternative 3 provided the best tax consequences because a charitable contribution of this stock by the Bank would amount to a far greater tax saving than a similar contribution by the Bank Building Co.\n \nIt was legal counsel’s opinion that alternative 3 was feasible and prudent from a tax standpoint. (Stip. par. 13, Ex. D.)\n \nSubsequently, Mr. Moorehead indicated to Mr. Dissmeyer that they should proceed with “alternative #3.” (Stip. Ex. F.) On January 7, 1966 Mr. Dissmeyer made the following written request to Mr. Halls, an attorney serving as an advisor to a legal department maintained by the Bank:\nPlease draft the appropriate resolution for the Board of the Northwestern Bank Building Company to take in declaring a dividend consisting of this stock. That Board is scheduled to meet on January 17. Please return the proposed resolution to me so it can be considered on the agenda.\n \nIf this dividend is declared, we will propose that the Bank donate to the Foundation all stock presently owned. This would include holdings in Cracker Creek Gold Mining Company, Boise Cascade Corporation, Greyhound Corporation, and the Northstar Center. I don’t recall if a resolution is necessary to make such a donation to the Foundation. If one is appropriate, please draft that resolution also so that I might have it for consideration at our Board meeting on January 20. (Emphasis supplied.) (Stip. par. 13, Ex. F.)\n \n \nAt the Salary and Budget Committee meeting, alternative 3 was discussed as follows:\nThe Committee also discussed a proposal to have the Northwestern Bank Building Company declare a dividend of the 10,000 shares of Center, Inc. stock which it now owns. The bank in turn would donate this . . . to the Northwestern Foundation. (Stip. Ex. I.)\n \n \nOn January 17, 1966, the Board of Directors of the Bank Building Co. adopted the resolution whereby the Bank Building Co. declared a “dividend” of its 10,000 shares in the Center, Inc. to the Bank. (Stip. par. 14, Ex. G.) The actual transfer of the stock from the Bank Building Co. to the Bank took place on January 18, 1966. (Stip. par. 16.) Two days later, the Board of Directors of the Bank adopted the resolution whereby the Bank transferred the 10,000 shares in the Center, Inc. to the Foundation, thus completing alternative 3. (Stip. par. 17, Ex. H.) The “dividend” declared by the Bank Building Co. to the Bank was the first dividend declared by the Bank Building Co. in its history. (Stip. par. 15.)\n \nThereafter, the Bank claimed charitable deductions for the value of the Center, Inc. stock, that is $932,537.00, on its income tax returns for the years 1966, 1967 and 1968. Since the Bank had made other charitable contributions in the year 1966 which alone used up the 5% limitation on charitable deductions imposed by § 170(b)(2) of the Code, the claimed charitable deductions produced no tax effect until the year 1967. (Stip. par. 20, 21 and 22.)\n \nPursuant to Section 482 of the Code, the Commissioner disallowed the charitable deductions for the Center, Inc. stock claimed by the Bank on its 1967 and 1968 income tax returns and allocated those deductions to the Bank Building Co. which resulted in a refund to the Bank Building Co. of $11,035.91 in tax plus $1,408.51 in interest. The disallowance resulted in deficiencies in tax to the Bank of $62,915.84 and $127,103.00 plus assessed interest for the years 1967 and 1968 respectively. (Stip. par. 24.) On January 4, 1973, the Bank made full payment of the additional taxes and interest due for 1967. (Stip. par. 25.) On December 27, 1972, the Bank paid the additional taxes and interest due for 1968. (Stip. par. 26.) By this suit, the Bank seeks a refund of those amounts, plus statutory interest.\n*3 II. Law\nSection 482 of the Code provides as follows:\n \nIn any case of two or more organizations, trades, or businesses (whether or not incorporated, whether or not organized in the United States, and whether or not affiliated) owned or controlled directly or indirectly by the same interests, the Secretary or his delegate may distribute, apportion, or allocate gross income, deductions, credits, or allowances between or among such organizations, trades or business, if he determines that such distribution, apportionment, or allocation is necessary in order to prevent evasion of taxes or clearly to reflect the income of any of such organizations, trades, or business. 26 U. S. C. § 482.\n \n \nThus, Section 482 grants the Commissioner the power to closely scrutinize all transactions between mutually controlled taxpayers and to place a controlled taxpayer on a parity with an uncontrolled taxpayer.\n \nIn Aiken Drive-in Theatre Corp. v. United States [60-2 USTC P 9616], 281 F. 2d 7 (4th Cir. 1960), (Aiken), the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit commented as follows upon the Commissioner’s authority by quoting from the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit as follows:\n“His object is to arrive at the true net income of each controlled taxpayer and the technique used is the application of the standard of an uncontrolled taxpayer dealing at arm’s length with another uncontrolled taxpayer. Whenever the lack of an arm’s length relationship produces a different economic result from that which would ensue in the case of two uncontrolled taxpayers dealing at arm’s length, the Commissioner is authorized to allocate gross income and deductions.”\n \n \nCommissioner v. Chelsea Products, Inc., 3 Cir., 1952 [52-2 USTC P 9370] 197 F. 2d 620, 623. 281 F. 2d at 9-10.\n \nThe burden is upon the taxpayer to prove that the Commissioner’s determination is arbitrary or capricious. Aiken, at 10.\n \nIn evaluating that challenged transaction, it is important to determine whether or not transaction(s) in question was solely for the purpose of reaping a tax benefit as opposed to in furtherance of a real and valid business purpose. Id.\n \nFurthermore, in applying Section 482 it is important to keep in mind that the challenged transaction would be lawful if between noncontrolled taxpayers. In National Securities Corp. v. Commissioner [43-2 USTC P 9560], 137 F. 2d 600 (3rd Cir. 1943), cert. denied 320 U. S. 794 (1943), the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit observed:\n[S]ection 45 [now section 482] is directed to the correction of particular situations in which the strict application of the other provisions of the act will result in a distortion of the income of affiliated organizations. In every case in which the section is applied its application will necessarily result in an apparent conflict with the literal requirements of some other provision of the act. If this were not so Section 45 would be wholly superfluous. We accordingly conclude that the application of Section 45 may not be denied because it appears to run afoul of the literal provisions of [the Code] if the Commissioner’s action in allocating under the provisions of Section 45 the loss involved in this case was a proper exercise of the discretion conferred upon him by the section. 137 F. 2d at 602.\n \n \n*4 This Court cannot find any abuse of discretion in the Commissioner’s allocation of the charitable contribution to the Bank Building Co. as opposed to the Bank.\n \nClearly, the purpose of the stock dividend was not any business purpose but rather for the sole purpose of avoiding otherwise adverse tax consequences. See, Aiken, at 10.\n \nFurthermore, the tax consequences of this plan resulted in a tax loss to the Bank Building Co. and a tax gain to the Bank. Certainly, the economic result of this dividend was different from that which would ensue in the case of two uncontrolled taxpayers dealing at arm’s length. See, Section 482, supra; Aiken, at 9-10; and Commissioner v. Chelsea Products, Inc., supra, 197 F. 2d at 623.\n \nThe research of the parties and this Court has not disclosed any case where a charitable deduction has been allocated among related entities. However, a closely analogous case is presented in National Security Corp. v. Commissioner, supra, where the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit upheld an allocation of a stock loss deduction from subsidiary to parent. The parent purchased stock in 1929 and held on to it until 1936 when it was almost valueless. Instead of selling the stock for a loss on the market, it sold the stock to its wholly owned subsidiary. The Court upheld the Commissioner’s reallocation under Section 45 of the Code [precursor to Section 482] because “the shifting of the loss to the subsidiary [gave] an artificial picture of its true income and one which it was unnecessary for the Commissioner to accept.” 137 F. 2d at 603.\n \nFirst, the Bank argues that because payment of a dividend by a subsidiary corporation to its parent can never take place between unrelated taxpayers, no arm’s length standard exists by which income distortion can be measured under Section 482. This Court rejects this argument.\n \nIt was not an abuse of discretion for the Commissioner to determine, applying Section 482, that an uncontrolled corporation, dealing at arm’s length, would not have declared this dividend to a non-controlling corporate stockholder. It would be unreasonable to assume that Section 482 is so narrow as to allow only a comparison of “subsidiary” corporations.\n \nFurthermore, the Supreme Court has held that the Commissioner has power to reallocate income under Section 482 where a holding company has complete power to shift income among its subsidiaries and has exercised that power so that the true taxable income of a subsidiary is understated. Commissioner v. First Security Bank of Utah 72-1 USTC P 9292A], 405 U. S. 394 (1972).1 See also, National Security Corp. v. Commissioner, discussed supra. These cases foreclose any argument that Section 482 was not intended to apply to shifts of income between subsidiary corporations and their parents.\n \n*5 Secondly, the Bank argues that because intercompany dividends are not included in the examples contained in Treas. Reg. § 1.482-2 promulgated in interpretation of Section 482, they are not among the types of transactions that Section 482 is directed toward. This Court must also reject this argument.\n \nThe Bank correctly states in its Brief that:\nThe purpose of § 482, it is said in Reg. § 1.482-1(b)(1) is to determine the “true taxable income” of a controlled taxpayer as though such taxpayer were an “uncontrolled taxpayer dealing at arm’s length with another uncontrolled taxpayer,” which is accomplished, it is said in paragraph (c) of the same regulation, by subjecting “[t]ransactions between one controlled taxpayer and another” to “special scrutiny” so as to ascertain whether the income of the controlled taxpayer “is other than it would have been had the taxpayer * * * been an uncontrollable taxpayer dealing at arm’s length with another uncontrolled taxpayer.” Plaintiff’s Reply Brief at 2-3.\n \n \nThere is nothing in the language of Treas. Reg. § 1.482-1(b)(1) which is inconsistent with applying Section 482 to transactions between subsidiary corporations. The purpose of Section 482 and Treas. Reg. § 1.482-1(b)(1) is to deal with situations where control distorts income. It would be a practical impossibility to deal with each and every potential situation by specific example. However, none of the examples contained in Treas. Reg. § 1.482-2 are inconsistent with imposing liability in the instant case.2\n \nFinally, the Court finds no merit in the plaintiff’s arguments that because at the time the dividend was declared, it was not obligated to donate the stock to the Foundation, it cannot be liable for a violation of Section 482.\n \nThe plaintiff relies upon Hudspeth v. United States [73-1 USTC P 9136], 471 F. 2d 275 (8th Cir. 1972) (Hudspeth); Winton v. Kelm [54-2 USTC P 9443], 122 F. Supp. 649 (D. Minn. 1954) (Winton); and Carrington v. Commissioner [73-1 USTC P 9370], 476 F. 2d 704 (5th Cir. 1973) (Carrington), to support its argument that because the Bank did not obligate itself to give the stock to the Foundation before the stock dividend was declared by the Bank Building Co. the Commissioner cannot reallocate the deduction to the Bank under Section 482.\n \n*6 First of all, none of these cases involved an attempt by the Commissioner to reallocate taxes under Section 482.3\n \nThese cases involved alleged anticipatory assignment of income in situations where taxpayers made a gift of stock to charity in close proximity to a stock redemption or liquidation of a corporation.\n \nSecondly, the important consideration in those cases was whether or not the taxpayer had the power to control the liquidation or redemption and not the time seqeunce of the stock transfer and liquidation or redemption.\n \nIn Carrington, relied on heavily by the Bank, the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit held that where the taxpayer had irrevocably delivered title to a controlling interest in shares of a corporation to a church, the subsequent redemption of those shares by the church, without prior obligation to do so, in exchange for a residence, was a taxpayer’s gift of the stock. The fact that the taxpayer could not control the actions of the church after the stock gift was made was determinative in insulating the taxpayer from a dividend tax on the transfer of the residence. 476 F. 2d at 708-709.\n \nIn Hudspeth the Court pointed out that although the corporate liquidation was not irrevocable the important factor was that the taxpayer retained substantial control over the liquidation proceedings due to his control of the corporation. 471 F. 2d at 277-278.\n \nWinton was distinguished in Hudspeth upon the grounds that the taxpayer in Winton did not have control over the liquidation after the stock transfer was made. The Court in Hudspeth noted that the important question was whether or not the transferee would have the legal capacity to rescind the donor’s original intent. If he would, then there was a legitimate gift of stock and not merely an anticipatory assignment of income. 471 F. 2d at 278-279.\n \nIn the instant case, the Bank had absolute control over the Bank Building Co. at all relevant times.\n \nTherefore, even if this Court should accept the proposition that these cases, which as previously mentioned did not involve Section 482 allocations, are on point, they would not support the Bank’s position.\n \nSection 482 involves an entirely different proposition from that considered in these cases. While these cases are concerned with the character of a deduction (stock or income), Section 482 is concerned with who can claim a deduction as among controlled taxpayers.\n \nThe fact remains that the dividend was declared for the purpose of reducing the Bank’s (controlling taxpayer) tax liability and that the result was different from that which reasonably could be expected to occur between uncontrolled taxpayers. Therefore, the Commissioner had the authority under Section 482 to allocate the deduction to the Bank Building Co. (controlled corporation) and disallow the deduction to the Bank (controlling corporation) in order to reflect the true income of each corporation.\n \n*7 THEREFORE, for the reasons herein discussed, IT IS ORDERED:\n1. Plaintiff’s motion for summary judgment upon stipulated facts is denied.\n \n2. Defendant’s motion for summary judgment upon stipulated facts is granted and this case is ordered dismissed.\n \n \nIT IS SO ORDERED.\n \nAll Citations\nNot Reported in F.Supp., 1976 WL 1016, 37 A.F.T.R.2d 76-1400, 76-1 USTC P 9408\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n|\n1\n|The Court found that Section 482 was not properly applied in this case because the taxpayer was prohibited by national banking laws from receiving the income (sales commissions) which the Commissioner sought to attribute to it under Section 482. No such statutory prohibition is present in the instant case.\n|\n2\n|Paragraph (a) gives the example of a loan or advance by one such taxpayer to another with no interest charge or an interest charge “not equal to an arm’s length rate.” The example given in paragraph (b) is of services performed by one of the affiliated taxpayers for another without charge or for a charge other than arm’s length. Use or occupancy of tangible property without charge or with an other-than-arm’s length charge is dealt with in paragraph (c). Paragraph (d) relates to transactions between related taxpayers involving the transfer or use of intangible property for other than arm’s length consideration. The last paragraph, (e), relates to sales of tangible property by one such taxpayer to another for other than arm’s length consideration.\n|\n3\n|Nor was Section 482 involved in Hines, Jr. v.
