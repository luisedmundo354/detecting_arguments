B&L traces its roots to an optical shop located in Rochester that was founded in 1853 by John J. Bausch and Henry Lomb. Prior to World War I, B&L became the first producer in the United States of optical quality glass, a vital material for military instruments, that freed the United States from its dependence on European sources of such glass.

 B&L began manufacturing and selling soft contact lenses during 1971. Prior to 1980, B&L\rquote s only manufacturing facility that had the ability to produce soft contact lenses using the spin cast process was located in Rochester (Rochester facility). B&L determined that it was prudent to establish additional soft contact lens manufacturing capacity overseas in order to minimize regulatory delays, establish an alternative supply source to the Rochester facility, and have a facility capable of more efficiently serving the increasingly important European markets. Because of incentives, including tax benefits, offered by the Government of the Republic of Ireland (Ireland) to induce companies to establish manufacturing facilities in Ireland, it was determined that B&L could realize those objectives most cost effectively in Ireland. Accordingly, for valid business reasons, on February 1, 1980, B&L Ireland was incorporated under the laws of Ireland to manufacture contact lenses. B&L Ireland\rquote s contact lens manufacturing facility was located in an industrial estate in Waterford, Ireland (Waterford industrial estate).

During the 1970s and the 1980s, B&L was increasingly turning its attention to international markets, including Southeast Asia where B&L was experiencing rapid growth in the sale of its products. Prior to 1972, B&L distributed its sunglasses and other products in certain Southeast Asian markets through independent distributors unrelated to B&L (independent distributors) that sold products other than B&L products, including in the case of at least one such distributor sunglasses produced by a competitor of B&L. The independent distributors did not focus on B&L products, and B&L maintained no direct contact with the retail optical shops in Southeast Asia that sold its sunglasses to consumers. In addition, B&L did not maintain any inventory in Southeast Asia and experienced long lead times on product orders originating in that market due to a delay in shipping products from the United States to that part of the world. This was the case even though during the early 1970s B&L was experiencing rapid sales growth in Southeast Asia as that market began to develop and its consumers could afford more luxury-type products.

In 1971, B&L opened an office in Hong Kong, its largest market in Southeast Asia. Although that office, which it called a representative office, acted as a liaison between B&L and its independent distributors, it did not maintain any inventory or employ its own sales force. In order to improve customer service and reduce the lead time on product orders, the director of the representative office in Hong Kong suggested to the Ophthalmic Division of B&L Inc.

 From 1972 through 1981, B&L Hong Kong functioned, inter alia, as a marketing, sales, warehousing, and distribution facility that purchased sunglasses, contact lenses, contact lens solutions, ophthalmic frames and lenses, scientific instruments, and other B&L products from related suppliers and sold them primarily to unrelated customers in Hong Kong, Taiwan, the Philippines, Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, and Indonesia. During those years, B&L Hong Kong\rquote s largest selling products were sunglasses that it purchased from B&L and that it did not assemble in Hong Kong, and its largest sales market for those sunglasses was Hong Kong. Throughout the period 1972 through 1981, B&L Hong Kong, and not B&L Inc., made the decisions affecting B&L Hong Kong\rquote s operations that related to its (1) leasing facilities, (2) personnel, (3) selection of the B&L product lines it offered, (4) B&L product inventory levels, (5) processing and billing of customer orders, and (6) account management. During those years, B&L Hong Kong expanded its sales of B&L products from approximately $300,000 to $10 million.

B&L began producing sunglasses in 1930 in response to an inquiry from the U.S. Army Air Corps, whose pilots needed protection from the glare of the sun while flying above the clouds. B&L began marketing sunglasses to the general public in 1936. Since 1937, B&L has marketed its sunglasses principally under the name \u8220\'3fRay-Ban\u8221\'3f.

B&L used stock keeping units (SKUs) to keep track of the finished sunglasses that it produced and sold. Every different type of finished sunglass product made by B&L was assigned a different SKU and represented a separate inventory item. Any variation in the sunglasses caused them to be assigned a different SKU. Thus, for example, if two pairs of large metals contained different colored lenses, or two pairs of Wayfarers were made with different colors of plastic, they were assigned different SKUs even though they were identical in every other respect.

For all relevant periods until sometime in 1986, B&L produced the glass lenses for its Ray-Ban sunglasses in its glass plant in Rochester (glass plant). The glass plant used a large glass tank capable of being subjected to extreme heat to turn sand and oxides into a molten material that could be pressed into shape for use as lenses in Ray-Ban sunglasses. Because plastic lenses had taken over the market for prescription eyeglasses by 1986, the glass plant was not commercially viable and was closed. B&L licensed its glass lens-making technology to Schott Glass Technology (Schott Glass), an unrelated third-party vendor that specialized in making glass products. B&L worked closely with Schott Glass to ensure that it produced quality lenses for use in Ray-Ban sunglasses.

 B&L put metal wire through a multiple-step process in order to produce the parts known as metal temples or fronts that were used in assembling certain of its sunglasses. Machines were used to draw, form, bend, or cut the metal wire and to press holes into the parts to create threaded holes. An electroplated coating was applied to the metal temples and fronts. As part of the process of fabricating metal sunglass parts, metal temples and fronts were subjected to 20 to 40 specific inspection steps, some of which involved random samples.

In the process of fabricating plastic frames, sheets of plastic were pressed by B&L to cut out plastic temples and fronts. Hinges were attached during the process. In the case of the plastic temples, heated wires were inserted into the temples in order to enable them to hold adjustments to their shape. As a final step to B&L\rquote s fabrication of plastic frames, the plastic temples or fronts were placed into a tumbling barrel, which contained wooden chips and wax to round their edges and polish them.

Regardless where the parts were fabricated and assembled into finished sunglasses, B&L maintained strict quality standards and specifications that the parts and finished sunglasses were required to meet. Specifications for all sunglasses were established by the specifications group at the B&L Frame Center in Rochester.

The primary reason for the selection of Ireland as a site for a sunglass assembly facility was the availability of grants from the Industrial Development Authority of Ireland (IDA) and other incentives provided by the Government of Ireland. The IDA, established pursuant to the Industrial Development Act of 1969, was responsible for promoting industrial development in Ireland. Its principal objective was to encourage Irish and foreign industrialists to establish operations in Ireland. Although the IDA helped companies organized in Ireland that did not export products from Ireland, certain service-industry companies, and small businesses, it favored those businesses setting up manufacturing operations that planned to export products from Ireland. The IDA offered a wide range of economic and financial incentives to firms that established operations in Ireland, including (1) capital grants in amounts up to 45 percent of the total cost of plant and equipment and (2) training grants in amounts up to 100 percent of the expenditures incurred to train employees.

In addition to opening a sunglass assembly facility in Ireland during 1982, B&L decided to open a sunglass assembly facility in Hong Kong during that year. During the early 1980s, B&L Hong Kong experienced rapid growth in the sale of sunglasses that it purchased from B&L. Because it experienced long lead times on finished sunglasses shipped from the United States, B&L Hong Kong found it necessary to maintain large inventories to avoid running out of certain SKUs of sunglasses. The cost of maintaining large inventories during the early 1980s was high because interest rates were approximately 18 percent at that time. In an effort to reduce costs and improve customer service, in early 1981, Mr. Y.H.

 that B&L Hong Kong assemble sunglasses in Hong Kong. Mr. Godfrey approved the decision on behalf of B&L Inc. to establish a sunglass assembly facility in Hong Kong. His decision was based on the following factors: (1) Because the parts for different SKUs of Ray-Bans were interchangeable, B&L Hong Kong could reduce its finished goods inventory yet process customer orders faster by assembling the sunglasses in Hong Kong;

 From 1982 through 1987, B&L Hong Kong leased facilities in the Watt\rquote s Industrial Building in Hong Kong for its sunglass assembly operations. During the period 1983 through 1985, B&L Hong Kong leased 1,200 square feet for those operations. During 1986 and 1987, it increased the amount of space it leased to 8,000 square feet, 4,000 square feet of which was used for production and 4,000 square feet of which was used as a ware-house. B&L Hong Kong leased additional space for offices for managers and other personnel involved in its sunglass assembly operations.

 The management of B&L Ireland was responsible for planning the production of B&L sunglasses in Ireland. That process, known as the production planning process, involved several stages. Approximately six months prior to the beginning of a fiscal year, the senior management team met to prepare a production budget. The production budget was based upon the customer sales and demand forecasts supplied to B&L Ireland by B&L Inc. and upon instructions from B&L Inc. as to which SKUs B&L Ireland was to be responsible for assembling. The production budget was designed to identify the resources (i.e., the necessary personnel and sunglass parts) required to meet the production plan. The next stage of the production planning process was to prepare the production forecast. That occurred approximately three months prior to the planned production and allowed B&L Ireland to order the necessary sunglass parts from B&L Inc. and B&L GmbH in time to begin the required production. The next phase in the production planning process was to prepare a production schedule that occurred one to two weeks in advance of actual production. The production schedule was prepared by the production supervisor and the materials supervisor and was based on what parts and production personnel were available at that time to meet required production as set by B&L Inc. Manufacturing orders were issued from the production schedule.

Shortly after commencing operations, B&L Ireland hired quality assurance inspectors to inspect the finished sunglasses it assembled. The initial training for inspectors was provided by an individual employed by B&L Inc. in the United States. Approximately 80 percent of the sunglasses produced at the B&L Ireland sunglass assembly facility during the initial stages of production failed a quality inspection and were returned to the original operator for reworking.

B&L Ireland undertook a number of steps to improve the quality of the sunglasses it produced. In May 1983, B&L Ireland established its own training program to ensure that its employees were competent to produce quality sunglasses. At that time, B&L Ireland employed one of its quality assurance auditors to serve as a full-time instructor. During 1985, B&L Ireland hired a second full-time instructor to become an instructor in assembling metal sunglasses.

Shortly thereafter, the quality assurance manager for the sunglass assembly operations was replaced.

When a new operator started, the instructor showed that person the workstation and told that person the names of the parts, tools, and equipment he or she was to use. For the first week of training, the new operator assembled parts that had been rejected by the quality assurance personnel. Beginning in the second week of training, the new operator started to assemble sunglasses from parts that had passed inspection as acceptable for use in B&L sunglasses. The new operator received one-on-one instruction in assembly techniques from an instructor. The time that the instructor spent with the new operator decreased as the training period progressed.

Beginning in the second week of the training program, the new operator was given targets for the quantity and quality of sunglasses to be assembled. For fully-trained operators, B&L Ireland established a target for assembly of 200 sunglasses per day. The target during the second week of instruction was approximately 25 percent of that amount or 50 sunglasses per day. During the first few weeks of training, the percentage of salable sunglasses assembled by the typical new operator was very low.

Training for other functions, such as packaging and washing, lasted four weeks. When B&L Ireland began applying leather to metal frames in 1986, the training for the leather application process lasted eight weeks. B&L Ireland conducted retraining programs for operators who were having difficulty meeting quantity and quality standards. Those programs typically lasted four weeks.

Most quality problems at B&L Ireland with respect to the basic SKUs tended to disappear over time as B&L Ireland\rquote s management and operators became more experienced in assembling those types of sunglasses. However, as new styles of sunglasses were added to B&L Ireland\rquote s products, new quality problems arose.

 Like B&L Ireland, before becoming fully operational, B&L Hong Kong underwent an initial period of training those involved in the sunglass assembly operations. Employees of B&L Hong Kong went to Rochester to observe B&L Inc.\rquote s assembly operations, and employees of B&L Inc. traveled to Hong Kong to help train employees of B&L Hong Kong. B&L Hong Kong also established a pilot program in which its employees assembled sample batches of sunglasses to send to B&L Inc. in Rochester for approval. Just as B&L Ireland experienced quality problems in the early stages of its operation, B&L Hong Kong was unable to meet its quality standards during 1983.

Unlike B&L Ireland, B&L Hong Kong did not hire any full-time instructors. Rather, training of new operators, inspectors, or other production personnel was handled by B&L Hong Kong\rquote s assistant production supervisor and group leaders. A new operator received one-on-one supervision for the first two or three weeks of training to teach that person the basic techniques of assembling sunglasses. An inspector kept track of the defective sunglasses assembled by the new operator in order to determine the areas in which the new operator needed to improve.

The typical new operator achieved B&L Hong Kong\rquote s basic daily productivity target of 150 units per day within four to six weeks after the commencement of the training program. During the first few weeks of training, the percentage of salable sunglasses assembled by the typical new operator was very low. A typical operator became skillful in the assembly of basic SKUs of sunglasses within nine to twelve months, but was not able to reach B&L Hong Kong\rquote s average output of 380 pairs of sunglasses per operator per day until sometime during that person\rquote s second year of employment. Some new operators failed to reach the minimum target level and were transferred to other areas.

B&L Ireland and B&L Hong Kong purchased from B&L Inc. metal fronts and temples, glass lenses, screws, packaging materials, and other parts and materials that they used in their respective sunglass assembly operations. B&L Ireland also purchased metal fronts and temples from B&L GmbH and plastic fronts and temples from B&L Inc. During 1987, B&L Ireland purchased nylon frames from Bolle, a French company unrelated to B&L, that B&L Ireland used to assemble Cats sunglasses. B&L Ireland assembled and sold no more than 35 pairs of Cats during 1987.

 B&L Ireland and B&L Hong Kong were responsible for managing and controlling the parts and materials used in their respective sunglass assembly operations. Each company maintained part numbers for each of the parts and materials that it purchased and used those part numbers for inventory control and management purposes. B&L Ireland and B&L Hong Kong typically received parts in boxes containing 50 or more units of a single item (i.e., a single part number). Each box of 50 or more units was referred to as a lot.

At B&L Ireland, the quality assurance department inspected purchased parts (incoming inspection) to screen out nonconforming or defective parts, identify problems that might arise during the production process, and identify opportunities to work with its suppliers to improve quality. To perform the incoming inspection, a trained inspector selected a random sample of parts from each lot, examined the parts visually and with various gauges and tools to identify cosmetic or aesthetic defects and dimensional defects, and marked each defective part. The inspector compared the total number of rejected parts to a standard to determine whether the lot passed or failed the incoming inspection. If too many of the purchased parts of a particular lot were determined to be defective, the inspector placed the failed lot in quarantine.

At B&L Hong Kong, the incoming inspection was performed by each operator who was trained and responsible for checking the parts prior to assembling them to ensure that they were of acceptable quality for assembly. If the operator found any defects, he or she was to ask the storekeeper to exchange the defective parts for nondefective parts. The storekeeper, who was also trained to perform quality inspections, verified whether those parts submitted by the operator were in fact defective. If they were defective, the storekeeper replaced them; if they were not defective, the storekeeper returned them to the operator for assembly.

Even if the parts purchased by B&L Ireland and by B&L Hong Kong had passed the incoming inspections conducted by each of those companies, an operator still could have experienced some difficulty in assembling those parts due to a problem known as tolerance stacking. Because the incoming inspections at both B&L Ireland and B&L Hong Kong tested to established tolerances, purchased parts were permitted to deviate from the nominal specification (viz., the ideal size) for those parts within a certain range and nonetheless pass inspection. For example, if an operator had attempted to insert a lens that was larger than the nominal specification into a frame that was smaller than the nominal specification, the operator may not have been able to assemble those parts correctly.

 The operator manipulated the right and left lenses into the respective eyewires of the front in a manner intended to avoid canted eyes (i.e., improper rotation and seating of the lenses in the fronts), partially assembled sunglasses (on which the lens could pop out after the lens screw had been tightened), and chipped or scratched lenses. If the lens had been larger than the nominal specification for lenses, or the frame had been smaller than the nominal specification for frames, the operator might have had to turn the lens screw more. If the operator had opened the lens screw too far, the screw might have popped out of the hole and the operator would have had to begin the process again. On the other hand, if the operator had not opened the lens screw far enough, the operator, by applying too much pressure trying to force the lens into place, might have chipped the lens, which would have caused the lens to be rejected as unacceptable for use in B&L sunglasses.

The operator inspected both the left and right lens for lens gaps (i.e, a gap between the lens and the frame). If the operator had identified a lens gap, the operator would have adjusted the curvature of the frame by manually bending the frame to meet the curvature of the lens. B&L Ireland and B&L Hong Kong frequently encountered lens gap problems with respect to a style of metals called Caravans that had square rather than round eyepieces. This was because the curvature of the top of the Caravan frame generally failed to meet the curvature of the lens. At B&L Ireland, operators were responsible for adjusting the curvature of the Caravans prior to assembly. At B&L Hong Kong, an individual known as a repairer was assigned to adjust the curvature of the Caravan frames before they were given to the operators for assembly.

After inspection and cleaning functions, packers packed each pair of inspected sunglasses at B&L Ireland and at B&L Hong Kong. The packer determined if any special packing material was necessary by reference to a special packing manual, placed a hang tag on the left temple if specified, closed the left and right temples, placed the sunglasses in a case, and placed the specified quantity in a finished goods box. After completing the packing process, the packer verified the quantity in the box and completed a quality sheet.

At B&L Ireland, the auditors, who were trained inspectors, performed an audit of the finished sunglasses that had been packaged to ensure that the products conformed to B&L\rquote s standards. The auditor selected a random sample of the sunglasses from a particular lot and performed inspection functions with respect to that sample similar to the 100-percent inspection performed by inspectors. If the auditor had identified too many defects in the samples inspected, the lot would have failed the audit. In that event, all the sunglasses in the lot would have been returned to the inspector for another 100-percent inspection, and the inspector would have corrected any defects identified and would have sent the lot back to the auditor for reauditing.

B&L Hong Kong did not have any personnel devoted solely to carrying out the audit function with respect to finished sunglasses. Its cleaners, who cleaned each sunglass unit with a hand cloth following the washing process, and its packers were trained in inspection procedures needed to perform the audit function. The cleaners and packers performed inspection functions similar to the inspections conducted by B&L Ireland\rquote s auditors. However, rather than inspecting only a random sample of each lot, each pair of sunglasses at B&L Hong Kong received a second inspection conducted by the cleaners and packers.

In addition to assembling metals, B&L Ireland\rquote s personnel assembled plastics. B&L Hong Kong did not perform any operations that resulted in plastic sunglasses and did not even sell many B&L plastic sunglasses assembled outside B&L Hong Kong. This was principally because the bridge on the plastics was too wide for the average Asian face, which tended to be smaller than the average Caucasian face, and, unlike metals, plastics did not have nosepads that could be adjusted to fit the Asian face.

In assembling plastics, B&L Ireland\rquote s personnel used a heating tunnel equipped with temperature and speed controls in order to render the plastic fronts sufficiently malleable so as to permit the insertion of the lenses and the formation of the headcurve of the fronts. The heating tunnel, which contained a conveyor belt running through the machine, heated the front with electrical elements located on the top of the tunnel. Although the specifications for a particular SKU established initial settings for the temperature and speed, the operator was responsible for adjusting those controls as necessary to facilitate the lensing process. If a front had not been hot enough when it exited the tunnel, the operator could not have inserted both lenses without damaging either the fronts or the lenses. On the other hand, if the front had been too hot when it exited the heating tunnel, it could have suffered heat damage such as sunken plaques,

The operator measured the leather (including marking where the nosepad arm was located) and cut off any excess leather so that the leather piece would fit the front. The operator applied acetone to the side of the leather with the glue on it to activate the glue and applied the leather to the front. The operator (1) used a soldering iron to burn off any excess thread; (2) used modeling tools to press the leather down to avoid gaps where the metal was showing; and (3) placed the front in a pressurized trap that pressed the leather tightly against the front to avoid problems with loose leather that was not secured to the front. After the operator examined the fronts for defects in the leather application and corrected any defects, the operator applied nosepads to the leather fronts.

B&L Ireland transferred the sunglasses it assembled to a distribution warehouse located in Culembourg, Holland. B&L Ireland did not maintain a sales or marketing staff. The marketing for B&L Ireland was handled by Bausch & Lomb United Kingdom (B&L United Kingdom) in London. The sunglasses assembled by B&L Ireland were sold primarily for distribution in Europe and the Middle East. Most of its European customers were B&L subsidiaries that operated warehouses in most of the European countries. In the Middle East, most of B&L Ireland\rquote s customers were independent distributors that sold other products in addition to Ray-Bans. B&L Ireland did not sell any sunglasses in Ireland.

 Not all of the B&L sunglasses sold in Europe and the Middle East were assembled at the B&L Ireland sunglass assembly facility. B&L Ireland tended to manufacture SKUs of the biggest runners (i.e., the best selling styles of sunglasses) so that it was not required to train employees to assemble those products that were in less demand.

B&L Hong Kong sold the sunglasses it assembled for distribution in Southeast Asia. It sold sunglasses directly to retail optical shops in Hong Kong and sold to both related and independent distributors for distribution in the remainder of Southeast Asia. In addition to selling the sunglasses it assembled, B&L Hong Kong sold B&L sunglasses not assembled by it as well as other B&L products.

From 1960 through the early 1980s, Sidney P. Davis (Mr. Davis) was an employee of Polaroid U.K., which marketed and distributed sunglasses in the United Kingdom. At the time he joined Polaroid U.K., it sold sunglasses that were assembled for it by Polarizer U.K., an unrelated company, from lenses that Polaroid U.K. imported from the United States and from frames purchased by Polaroid U.K. After joining Polaroid U.K., Mr. Davis, acting as a representative of that company, became the production manager of the assembly operations conducted by Polarizer U.K. His work included improving the quality control of the vendors supplying frames and training the Polarizer U.K. staff in quality control procedures. In Mr. Davis\rquote  view, the Polarizer U.K. factory in which he worked was a manufacturing unit engaged in production, and he was a manufacturing manager.

 The assembly operations conducted by Polaroid U.K. and Polarizer U.K. throughout the period during which Mr. Davis was production manager were very similar to the assembly operations conducted by B&L Ireland and by B&L Hong Kong. Parts were purchased, sorted, and inspected. The parts were assembled into finished sunglasses with each operator responsible for quality control. The finished sunglasses underwent a final inspection before they were shipped.

In a case in which a controlled foreign corporation purchases parts or materials which it then transforms or incorporates into a final product, income from the sale of the final product would not be foreign base company sales income if the corporation substantially transforms the parts or materials, so that, in effect, the final product is not the property purchased. Manufacturing and construction activities (and production, processing, or assembling activities which are substantial in nature) would generally involve substantial transformation of purchased parts or materials.

Both parties rely on the opinions of engineers. Petitioners rely on the opinions of Harry W. Matthews, Jr. (Mr. Matthews), an engineer employed by Arthur D. Little\rquote s Manufacturing and Transportation Industries Section, who had no experience in the sunglass industry. Although Mr. Matthews concluded that B&L Ireland and B&L Hong Kong constituted separate manufacturing entities, he did not address whether the assembly operations of each of those companies were generally considered to constitute the manufacture of sunglasses. We also question some of the facts underlying Mr. Matthews\rquote  analysis. For example, he concluded that the respective sunglass assembly operations of B&L Ireland and B&L Hong Kong involved approximately 65 steps in order to assemble metals, 70 steps to assemble leathers, and an additional 95 steps to apply leather to metal frames.

Respondent relies on the opinions of Michael L. Philpott, Ph.D. (Dr. Philpott), a manufacturing engineer, who, as of the time of the trial herein, was employed as an assistant professor of engineering responsible for teaching classes in manufacturing. Dr. Philpott had no experience in the sunglass industry. His opinions were formulated from the perspective of an engineer and set forth certain hypertechnical views that we do not believe Congress had in mind when it enacted section 954(d)(1) and that we did not find helpful to our resolution of the issues herein. By way of illustration, Dr. Philpott drew subtle distinctions among the terms \u8220\'3fmanufacture\u8221\'3f, \u8220\'3fmanufacturer\u8221\'3f, and \u8220\'3fmanufacturing\u8221\'3f.

Dr. Philpott opined during the trial of these cases that, unless a company designed a product, it could not be considered the manufacturer of that product if it performed only assembly, and no parts fabrication operations. However, he further testified that product design was not considered part of the manufacturing process during the early and mid-1960s when Congress enacted subpart F and the Treasury issued the regulations thereunder.

 Petitioners rely on the opinions of Gary E. Holdren (Mr. Holdren), a certified public accountant (C.P.A.). His analyses were made from an accounting perspective. Respondent relies on the opinions of three employees (viz., Scott D. Hakala, Ph.D. (Dr. Hakala), who holds a Ph.D. in economics; Martin D. Hanan, who is a chartered financial analyst and an accredited senior appraiser; and Ray A. Sheeler, who is a C.P.A.) of Business Valuation Systems (BVS) who prepared an opening report (BVS report) and a rebuttal report. Although the BVS report incorporated accounting concepts, it primarily sets forth economic analyses of the respective assembly operations of B&L Ireland and B&L Hong Kong.

The respective opinions of Mr. Holdren and the authors of the BVS report appear to require different conclusions with respect to the substantiality of the respective assembly operations conducted by B&L Ireland and B&L Hong Kong. It appears that at least part of the differences in those opinions is attributable to the fact that Mr. Holdren\rquote s analyses were based on accounting principles and the analyses in the BVS report were based primarily on economic principles.

 Nonetheless, we have reservations regarding the respective analyses performed by Mr. Holdren and the three individuals who prepared the BVS report. For example, with respect to Mr. Holdren, he adopted the classifications that B&L Ireland and B&L Hong Kong used to classify certain purchased parts as either direct or indirect materials, rather than making his own independent determinations of such classifications. Although the classifications used by B&L Ireland and by B&L Hong Kong are not necessarily inappropriate for management accounting purposes, there appear to be different, acceptable methods of classifying certain types of materials for those purposes. Petitioners have not convinced us that the classification method chosen by B&L Ireland and by B&L Hong Kong, and adopted by Mr. Holdren, is the most appropriate method for purposes of section 954(d)(1) and the regulations thereunder.

We have found that operators at both B&L Ireland and B&L Hong Kong required training and experience in sunglass assembly techniques before they became proficient at assembling sunglasses. At the B&L Ireland sunglass assembly facility, the training period for each new operator, which included one-on-one supervision by a full-time instructor, lasted 13 weeks.

During the first few weeks of training, the percentage of salable sunglasses assembled by a new operator at both B&L Ireland and B&L Hong Kong was very low. Even at the end of the 13-week training program at the B&L Ireland sunglass assembly facility, the typical operator was able to assemble only 70 percent of B&L Ireland\rquote s basic target of 200 sunglasses per day. Although the typical operator at the B&L Hong Kong sunglass assembly facility was able to achieve the basic daily productivity target of 150 sunglasses per day within four to six weeks after the commencement of the training program, that person generally was not able to achieve B&L Hong Kong\rquote s average output of 380 sunglasses per day until some time in that person\rquote s second year of employment. Not all operators were able to assemble all SKUs of sunglasses assembled by B&L Ireland and by B&L Hong Kong, and some operators were not able to reach a sufficient level of proficiency to continue to function as operators. At the B&L Ireland sunglass assembly facility, if an operator began assembling a new style of sunglasses or switched from assembling plastics to metals, the operator underwent additional training.

B&L Ireland\rquote s experiences in establishing its sunglass assembly operations illustrate the need for trained and experienced personnel (including operators, inspectors, and management) to assemble quality sunglasses. When it first began assembling sunglasses during 1982 and 1983, B&L Ireland experienced a rejection rate of approximately 80 percent of the sunglasses assembled by its operators. To improve the quality of its product, B&L Ireland\rquote s sunglass operations (1) instituted its own training program, including hiring full-time instructors beginning in May 1983; (2) underwent a quality audit performed during 1984 by the quality manager of B&L Ireland\rquote s contact lens operations in order to develop standard operating procedures; (3) replaced its quality assurance manager shortly after concluding the quality audit; (4) reduced its expected output in its production budget for its second year of operation (viz., 1984); and (5) hired outside consultants during 1983 and 1984 to develop a job evaluation system and improve the efficiencies of its operations. Most quality problems at the B&L Ireland sunglass assembly facility with respect to the basic SKUs tended to disappear over time as the operators and management became more skillful in their respective functions and responsibilities in the sunglass assembly operations.

 B&L Ireland and B&L Hong Kong relied upon their respective operators to perform their functions and responsibilities properly. If those operators had failed to perform them properly, the sunglasses assembled by those companies would not have met B&L\rquote s quality standards or the appearance and fit expectations of the ultimate consumers of quality sunglasses. While some operator errors, such as failure to make an appropriate adjustment during the truing process or failure to correct a lens gap problem, were able to be fixed through reworking the sunglasses, many operator errors, such as chipped lenses or broken solder on the endpieces, required the damaged parts to be scrapped and replaced.

As the operators at B&L Ireland and B&L Hong Kong became more experienced at assembling particular SKUs, the operators became skilled at reducing damage to the parts and meeting B&L\rquote s specifications for quality. They tended to learn, for example, (1) how much pressure to apply to a part in order to bend it without breaking or otherwise damaging it; (2) how much to adjust the speed and temperature controls on the heating tunnel in order to make the plastic fronts sufficiently malleable to insert lenses without overheating the fronts; (3) how to recognize and correct lens gap problems; and (4) how to overcome problems caused by tolerance stacking.

To support her position that the respective sunglass assembly operations conducted by B&L Ireland and B&L Hong Kong did not require substantial skill, training, or experience, respondent relies on the testimony of Dr. Cohen. At the time of the trial herein, Dr. Cohen was a licensed optician and an associate professor of Ophthalmic Dispensing Technology. Dr. Cohen testified that he had taught basic assembly of prescription eyeglasses to students of various levels of education and that it did not require much time or training for a person to become competent at assembling eyeglasses. Dr. Cohen admitted, however, that his experience related to the dispensing of prescription eyeglasses through optical shops and that it did not include mass production techniques.

We are unwilling to rely on Dr. Cohen\rquote s testimony to refute the direct evidence of the training and experience required of operators at B&L Ireland and B&L Hong Kong in order to assemble sunglasses that met B&L\rquote s quality standards. It appears that a person assembling prescription eyeglasses for a retail optical shop is not required to learn a standard technique for that assembly. All that is important is the end result, not the method utilized to achieve that result. For example, Dr. Cohen testified that when students in the Cleveland Job Corps, a program in which Dr. Cohen trained nontraditional students in Ophthalmic Dispensing Technology, including prescription eyeglass assembly, were learning how to insert lenses into metal frames, they were given study guides that outlined the materials to be used and the basic tasks to be performed, and they were allowed to perform those tasks at their own pace. Dr. Cohen did not provide instruction in assembly techniques unless a student was having difficulty completing the assembly.

 While such result-oriented instruction may have been acceptable in a setting such as the Cleveland Job Corps where the participants were expected to assemble an optimum of 15 to 20 pairs of eyeglasses per week, B&L Ireland and B&L Hong Kong trained their respective employees to use a standard technique for sunglass assembly that the operators could repeat several hundred times per day efficiently and correctly so as to result in consistently producing quality sunglasses. Unlike prescription eyeglasses that are assembled to fit a particular face and for a specific prescription, sunglasses must be assembled to fit a standard face. Consequently, there is a greater need for consistent results with respect to the assembly of sunglasses than with respect to the assembly of prescription eyeglasses. The use of a standard technique for sunglass assembly allowed operators at B&L Ireland and at B&L Hong Kong to achieve maximum output of finished sunglasses that met B&L\rquote s quality standards with the least damage to the parts occurring during the process.

 The record in these cases shows that it took significant periods of training and experience for operators to learn the standardized techniques utilized by B&L Ireland and by B&L Hong Kong to assemble sunglasses ready for sale to the ultimate consumers. Even Dr. Cohen admitted that certain problems encountered by B&L Ireland and by B&L Hong Kong might have been attributable to the fact that they were mass producing sunglasses, rather than assembling prescription eyeglasses for a retail optical shop.

In addition, the sunglasses assembled at both B&L Ireland and B&L Hong Kong were inspected at least once by someone other than the operator who assembled them to ensure that the sunglasses complied with B&L\rquote s quality standards. Dr. Cohen testified that, at least in Ohio, an optician was required to examine prescription eyeglasses before they were distributed to the ultimate consumer. Although the position of an inspector at B&L Ireland and at B&L Hong Kong was not the equivalent of an optician who is licensed and trained to dispense prescription eyeglasses, the record in these cases establishes that inspectors at B&L Ireland and at B&L Hong Kong required significant periods of training and experience in order to perform their jobs properly. The need for trained inspectors to ensure that the sunglasses assembled by B&L Ireland and by B&L Hong Kong met B&L\rquote s quality standards further demonstrates the substantiality of the assembly operations conducted by each of those corporations.

Respondent also contends that the assembly operations at issue did not require a sufficient investment in physical capital to be substantial in nature. Although we agree with respondent that the respective sunglass assembly operations conducted by B&L Ireland and B&L Hong Kong did not require a large investment in physical capital, her contention ignores the fact that those operations required a substantial investment in human capital in order to produce quality sunglasses. Without a trained and experienced workforce, neither B&L Ireland nor B&L Hong Kong would have been able to produce quality sunglasses that met B&L\rquote s quality standards. In fact, both B&L Ireland and B&L Hong Kong experienced significant quality problems during their respective first years of operation. Those operations could not readily be relocated since they were dependent on a trained and experienced workforce. In fact, the IDA considered B&L Ireland\rquote s sunglass assembly operations to create jobs of a sufficiently permanent nature to warrant the issuance of training grants to compensate B&L Ireland for the period during which its employees were not efficient at producing quality sunglasses.

 at 148. The products at issue herein are sunglasses. Sunglasses involve at least two distinct market segments: (1) Low-end or regular sunglasses, and (2) high-end or quality sunglasses. Sunglasses constitute a separate and distinct product from prescription eyeglasses. Sunglasses have noncorrective lenses, are tailored to fit a standard face, and are assembled prior to reaching the retailer. In contrast, prescription eyeglasses contain individually finished lenses, are tailored for a specific prescription and to fit an individual face, and are assembled by retail optical shops. We also note that the sunglass industry has its own trade organization, viz., the Sunglass Association of America (SAA), and that the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) has established standards for the sunglass industry to follow.

Our next inquiry is whether the sunglass industry generally considers the respective assembly operations of B&L Ireland and B&L Hong Kong to constitute the manufacture or production of sunglasses. In this respect, we find the opinions expressed by petitioners\rquote  expert Mr. Nieh to be most instructive. Mr. Nieh was employed by Polaroid in its sunglass business from 1956 through 1988. In addition to his participating in Polaroid\rquote s sunglass business, Mr. Nieh participated in, and served as the president of, the SAA and served on committees of ANSI in areas relating to sunglass standards.

In his opening report, Mr. Nieh discussed the sunglass industry in general, including the differences between low-end or regular sunglasses and high-end or quality sunglasses. He described the importance of \u8220\'3fappearance\u8221\'3f and \u8220\'3ffit\u8221\'3f to the consumer of quality sunglasses; that is to say, a consumer will not purchase a pair of quality sunglasses that are priced two-to-ten times higher than regular sunglasses unless they meet his or her standards for appearance and fit. He described the sunglass industry as a \u8220\'3fcottage industry\u8221\'3f because several levels of manufacturing, including parts fabrication and final assembly, are necessary to convert raw materials into finished sunglasses. Although Mr. Nieh recognized the importance of each level of manufacturing, he indicated that the sunglass industry considers the assembler, which he referred to as the finished goods manufacturer, as the most important stage in the manufacture of quality sunglasses. This is because the assembler \u8220\'3fmust produce the

He also detailed the reliance of the assembler of quality sunglasses on a trained and experienced work force and the quality procedures that must be utilized by that assembler to ensure that the sunglasses produced meet the consumers\rquote  standards for appearance and fit. Based on his experience in the sunglass industry, Mr. Nieh concluded that B&L Ireland and B&L Hong Kong conducted \u8220\'3fmanufacturing operations\u8221\'3f and that \u8220\'3fthe sunglass industry would certainly recognize B&L Ireland and B&L Hong Kong as engaged in the manufacture and sale of \u8216\'3fquality sunglasses.\u8221\'3f\u8217\'3f

 In addition to the testimony of Mr. Nieh, we also rely on the testimony of Mr. Davis who testified as a fact, and not an expert, witness. From 1963 through the early 1980s, Mr. Davis was an employee of Polaroid U.K., which marketed and distributed sunglasses in the United Kingdom. At the time he joined Polaroid U.K., it sold sunglasses that were assembled for it by Polarizer U.K., an unrelated company, from lenses that Polaroid U.K. imported from the United States and from frames purchased by Polaroid U.K. After joining Polaroid U.K., Mr. Davis, acting as a representative of that company, became the production manager of the assembly operations conducted by Polarizer U.K. His work included improving the quality control of the vendors supplying frames and training the Polarizer U.K. staff in quality control procedures.

The assembly operations conducted by Polaroid U.K. and Polarizer U.K. throughout the period during which Mr. Davis was production manager were very similar to the assembly operations conducted by B&L Ireland and by B&L Hong Kong. Parts were purchased, sorted, and inspected. The parts were assembled into finished sunglasses with each operator responsible for quality control. The finished sunglasses underwent a final inspection before they were shipped.

Mr. Davis testified that the factory in which he worked was a \u8220\'3fmanufacturing unit\u8221\'3f and that he was classified as a \u8220\'3fmanufacturing manager\u8221\'3f. He also referred to the work of Polarizer U.K. as \u8220\'3fproduction\u8221\'3f and indicated that customer returns were due to \u8220\'3fproduction problems\u8221\'3f. Thus, it appears that Polaroid U.K. generally considered the assembly operations conducted by Polarizer U.K., which were very similar to the sunglass assembly operations conducted by B&L Ireland and by B&L Hong Kong, to constitute the manufacture of sunglasses.

Petitioners also argue that the respective assembly operations conducted by B&L Ireland and B&L Hong Kong were generally considered to constitute the manufacture of sunglasses from various other perspectives. Both B&L Ireland and B&L Hong Kong used standard cost accounting to assist their management. Mr. Holdren, a C.P.A. relied upon by petitioners as an expert witness, concluded that the type and complexity of the respective cost accounting systems utilized by B&L Ireland and B&L Hong Kong are indicative of manufacturing companies and not distribution operations. Thus, both B&L Ireland and B&L Hong Kong used the types of accounting systems utilized by companies engaged in the manufacture of products.

 We also note that the Government of Ireland generally considered the assembly operations conducted by B&L Ireland to constitute the manufacture of sunglasses. Prior to the time during 1982 at which B&L Ireland initiated it sunglass assembly operations, the IDA awarded B&L Ireland both capital and training grants that were generally given only to manufacturing concerns that exported products from Ireland. Moreover, pursuant to an exemption that was generally available only with respect to goods manufactured in Ireland, B&L Ireland was relieved of its obligation to pay Ireland\rquote s corporation tax with respect to practically all, if not all, of its income from its sunglass assembly operations. Nor was B&L Ireland required to pay Ireland\rquote s VAT on the sunglass parts it imported into Ireland. This was because the regulations under the VAT provided an exemption for firms engaged in a manufacturing business that were importing goods for use in that business.

., is correct because even if it were, we would nonetheless find that the respective sunglass assembly operations conducted by B&L Ireland and B&L Hong Kong were not limited to packaging, repackaging, labeling, or minor assembly. B&L Ireland and B&L Hong Kong purchased sunglass parts that could not be sold to the ultimate consumers no matter how they were packaged. Through a series of operations, those companies assembled the parts that they purchased into quality sunglasses ready for sale to the ultimate consumers. Those sunglass assembly operations were not minor, nominal, or insignificant. They required trained and experienced personnel who could quickly and efficiently assemble sunglasses that met B&L\rquote s quality standards. In addition to the actual assembly of sunglasses, those operations also required trained inspection personnel to detect quality problems in both the purchased parts and the finished sunglasses and a management staff to plan and oversee the production operation. Although the assembly operations of B&L Ireland and B&L Hong Kong also included labeling and packaging operations, those operations were not limited to such \u8220\'3fministerial functions\u8221\'3f.

 To support her position that the assembly operations conducted by B&L Ireland and by B&L Hong Kong constituted minor assembly, respondent relies on the testimony of Dr. Philpott. In his opening report, Dr. Philpott opined that the assembly operations of each of those companies \u8220\'3fwould be considered by an industrial or manufacturing engineer as minor assembly, labeling, packaging, or repackaging.\u8221\'3f Dr. Philpott admitted, however, that the phrase \u8220\'3fminor assembly\u8221\'3f is not a term commonly used by industrial or manufacturing engineers.

Therefore, we need not determine whether the exception in section 954(b)(4) applies to that income.

We now turn to the parties\rquote  arguments under section 954(b)(4) relating to B&L Hong Kong\rquote s income from the sale of B&L products it did not assemble and from interest that the parties and/or the record make clear is at issue. Respondent argues that she did not abuse her discretion under section 954(b)(4) by failing to exclude the income at issue of B&L Hong Kong from the sale of B&L products it did not assemble and from interest from petitioners\rquote  gross income for their taxable years ended December 25, 1983, through December 28, 1986. Although the record in these cases might support a finding that B&L Hong Kong was not formed for a significant purpose of reducing taxes, it does not necessarily follow that respondent abused her discretion by failing to exclude the income at issue of B&L Hong Kong from the sale of B&L products it did not assemble and from interest from petitioners\rquote  gross income for their taxable years ended December 25, 1983, through December 28, 1986. In any event, the instant record does not support a finding that respondent abused her discretion by failing to determine that reduction of taxes was not a significant purpose for effecting the transactions that gave rise to that income.

We initially note that petitioners reported certain of B&L Hong Kong\rquote s income from sources other than the sale of sunglasses assembled by it as subpart F income for each of their taxable years ended December 30, 1984, through December 28, 1986. Although petitioners did not report subpart F income from B&L Hong Kong for their taxable year ended December 25, 1983, a memorandum prepared by B&L in connection with the tax audit of petitioners\rquote  taxable years ended December 25, 1983, and December 30, 1984, indicated that petitioners did not report any such income for their taxable year ended December 25, 1983, because B&L Hong Kong \u8220\'3fgenerated an overall loss from Subpart F operations\u8221\'3f for that year. Petitioners did not assert that any portion of B&L Hong Kong\rquote s income at issue from the sale of B&L products it did not assemble and from interest was excludible from their gross income under

It appears that, at least prior thereto, petitioners themselves had reason to believe that that income was not excludible from their gross income under section 954(b)(4) for their taxable years ended December 25, 1983, through December 28, 1986.

In addition, the type of business carried on by B&L Hong Kong that gave rise to the income at issue from the sale of B&L products it did not assemble was a sales business that derived income from the sale of B&L products that it (1) purchased from its parent or other related companies, (2) sold for use or consumption outside Hong Kong, and (3) did not manufacture or assemble in Hong Kong. Thus, the class of income at issue that B&L Hong Kong derived from that business was foreign base company sales income as defined in section 954(d)(1).

Moreover, the record shows that B&L\rquote s management was aware of the differences between the tax rates in Hong Kong and the United States during and immediately prior to the years at issue and that B&L\rquote s management made efforts during those years to reduce its overall tax burden.

At the conclusion of the trial herein, the Court ordered the parties to file seriatim briefs and limited the parties\rquote  respective briefs to a total of 150 pages, including the proposed findings of fact. Petitioners\rquote  opening and reply briefs totaled exactly 150 pages. It appears that they were able to so limit their briefs only by violating Rule 151(e)(3). That Rule requires the opening briefs of the parties to contain:

During the pretrial and trial phases of these cases, petitioners\rquote  lead counsel made it known to the Court on a number of occasions that he is no stranger to this Court, since he has appeared before us as attorney of record in a number of different cases. We therefore presume that he is, and in any event he and all counsel who appear before us should be, thoroughly familiar with this Court\rquote s Rules, including Rule 151(e)(3). Since respondent did not seek any sanctions from the Court for petitioners\rquote  failure to comply with Rule 151(e)(3), which we view as nothing more than their attempt to circumvent the page limitation we placed on the briefs in these cases, we shall impose no sanctions at this time. However, we caution petitioners and their counsel that any further violations of our Rules and Orders will be met with the imposition of appropriate sanctions, regardless whether respondent makes a request for sanctions.

For example, B&L produced different SKUs of sunglasses that used the same type of frame, but lenses of different colors. Lenses of the same design also were used interchangeably in certain different styles of sunglass frames. Each style of frame with each color of lens represented a different SKU. If B&L Hong Kong had not decided to assemble sunglasses in Hong Kong, it would have needed to maintain a finished goods inventory for every SKU in order to process orders quickly. By maintaining a sunglass assembly facility in Hong Kong, B&L Hong Kong was able to process an order without needing to maintain a finished goods inventory for every SKU. Rather, it simply needed to maintain an adequate supply of the interchangeable parts. By way of illustration, if B&L Hong Kong had not conducted assembly operations in Hong Kong and had estimated that it would sell 100 pairs of large metals, but had been unable to estimate whether its sales would be for large metals with green or with gray lenses, it would have needed to stock 100 finished pairs of each of those SKUs. However, if B&L Hong Kong were to conduct assembly operations, it could fill an order for 100 large metals with gray lenses, 100 large metals with green lenses, or some combination thereof simply by maintaining 100 pairs of frames for large metals, 100 pairs of gray lenses, and 100 pairs of green lenses. Thus, the total number of frames in B&L Hong Kong\rquote s inventory could be less than the number of frames in its inventory if it maintained enough finished goods inventory to fill those orders.

Except as stated below, the sunglass assembly operations conducted by B&L Ireland and by B&L Hong Kong were substantially the same. The sunglass assembly operations conducted by B&L Inc. in Rochester with respect to metals, plastics, Wings, and leathers were substantially similar to the sunglass assembly operations conducted by B&L Ireland with respect to those styles of sunglasses and by B&L Hong Kong with respect to those styles except plastics that B&L Hong Kong did not produce. Even at its facilities in Rochester, B&L Inc. treated sunglass assembly as a separate function from the fabrication of sunglass parts. The assembly operations at B&L Inc., B&L Ireland, and B&L Hong Kong received some parts from the same parts warehouse located in Rochester.

Parts placed in quarantine by B&L Ireland were not used for assembling sunglasses unless absolutely necessary. If it became necessary to use the quarantined parts, those parts were inspected to sort out the unusable parts. Quarantined parts were sometimes reworked to make them acceptable before they were used.

The category \u8220\'3fOthers\u8221\'3f primarily included styles called Classic Colours and Precious Metals. Those styles were metals that were coated with sprayed-on paint in the case of Classic Colours or with a coating of rhodium and ruthenium in the case of Precious Metals. B&L Ireland experienced some difficulty in assembling Classic Colours and Precious Metals because the coatings on those styles, which were applied by a third party, chipped off very easily.

Records from B&L Hong Kong for the years at issue show that the actual \u8220\'3fTime for 1 unit assembled\u8221\'3f ranged from a high of approximately two minutes during 1983 to a low of approximately one minute during 1987. Although no such records exist for B&L Ireland, Dr. Philpott, a manufacturing engineer and expert relied upon by respondent, estimated the time for assembly for (1) metals at 1.77 minutes, (2) plastics at 1.84 minutes, and (3) leathers (including applying the leather to the frames) at 4.06 minutes. Dr. Philpott made his estimates of the time required for assembly of the various styles of sunglasses using a design for assembly (DFA) analysis. DFA analysis utilizes a database of time required to perform certain assembly-related tasks in order to aid engineers in designing products in such a way that they can be assembled most efficiently.

Petitioners\rquote  argument does not relate to their last taxable year at issue (viz., the year ended Dec. 27, 1987) because sec. 954(b)(4) in effect for their taxable years ended Dec. 25, 1983, through Dec. 28, 1986, was amended in 1986 and was no longer effective for that last year.

On brief, respondent argues that the issue whether B&L Hong Kong\rquote s interest income is excludible under sec. 954(b)(4) is not a proper issue because it was not raised in the pleadings. Respondent is wrong. Petitioners amended their petition to assert that B&L Hong Kong\rquote s income from the sale of B&L products it did not assemble and from \u8220\'3fother revenues\u8221\'3f was excludible under sec. 954(b)(4).

Petitioners argue that B&L Hong Kong\rquote s interest income at issue is excludible from their gross income pursuant to sec. 954(b)(3)(A). The record does not establish the total amount of B&L Hong Kong\rquote s foreign base company income (determined without regard to sec. 954(b)(2) and (5)) for any of the taxable years ended Dec. 25, 1983, through Dec. 28, 1986. Consequently, we are unable to determine whether B&L Hong Kong\rquote s interest income (or any other foreign base company income that we have found herein) is excludible pursuant to sec. 954(b)(3)(A).
