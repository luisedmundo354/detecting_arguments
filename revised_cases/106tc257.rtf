On reconsideration, petitioners and the amici curiae make three primary arguments: (1) That the value of the Mexican pesos that were received by petitioner (or by Procesos, petitioner\rquote s Mexican subsidiary corporation) did not exceed petitioner\rquote s U.S. dollar cost of participating in the transaction and that petitioner, therefore, realized no gain on the transaction; (2) that the transaction should not be viewed as a taxable exchange because petitioner could not legally own an interest in the U.S. dollar-denominated debt of the Mexican Government; and (3) that if gain was realized over petitioner\rquote s cost of participating in the transaction, such gain should be regarded, under section 118, as a nontaxable capital contribution by the Mexican Government to petitioner or to Procesos.

Even though these three additional elements did not have an immediate hard currency cost to petitioner and did not increase petitioner\rquote s tax basis or tax cost in the transaction, such additional elements provided by petitioner to the Mexican Government represented valuable and material aspects of the transaction and should not be ignored if we are to properly value the currency consideration received by petitioner (namely, the Mex$1,736,694,000). Petitioner\rquote s argument (and that of the amici curiae) that the Mexican pesos are presumed equal to petitioner\rquote s US$634,000 currency cost of participating in this transaction ignores the value of these significant additional elements provided by petitioner.

Petitioner\rquote s purchase of the US$1,200,000 Mexican Government debt and petitioner\rquote s transfer of this debt to the Mexican Government for cancellation, without the Mexican Government spending any U.S. dollars, constituted a primary purpose of this transaction. If the financial interests of the Mexican Government would have been just as well-served (as the amici curiae apparently contend) by the Mexican Government itself purchasing for US$600,000 the US $1,200,000 Mexican Government debt and then canceling that debt, perhaps the transaction could have been so structured.

We therefore believe that it would be artificial to presume, as petitioner and the amici curiae would have us do, that the value of the Mex$1,736,694,000 (the currency consideration received by petitioner or by Procesos, as petitioner\rquote s designee, for participating in this transaction) equals petitioner\rquote s US$634,000 cost of purchasing the US$1,200,000 Mexican Government debt and transferring the debt to the Mexican Government. This argument ignores that in reality the Mexican Government acquired from petitioner not only the surrender of the debt, but also the additional three elements identified above.

The increase obtained as a result of the swap was Mex $738,594,000 (Mex$1,736,694,000 less Mex$998,100,000) which, on the date of the Debt/Equity Swap, was equal in value to US$444,000 (Mex$738,594,000 divided by 1,663.50 (pesos/dollar free-market exchange rate on date of swap)), which is precisely the amount of gain which respondent contends petitioner realized on the transaction (fair market value of Mex$1,736,694,000 received in exchange for the US$1,200,000 Face Amount Mexican Debt (US$1,044,000) less amount paid for the debt (US$600,000)), less US$34,000 of transaction costs.

At its simplest, a debt-equity swap (also known as a debt conversion) involves the purchase by a firm, usually foreign, of sovereign debt at a discount in the secondary market from the bank holding it. The issuing country then buys back the debt in local currency at close to its face value. The firm spends the local currency received in an approved manner within the country, usually to finance a fixed equity investment. Since the prepayment of the obligation is made at a substantial discount and the local funds are obtained at a much smaller discount, firms can realize a significant

With regard to the value of the Mex$1,736,694,000 that was received, petitioner and the amici curiae argue strenuously that the Court in our prior opinion improperly considered subjective factors to minimize the effect of certain restrictions on the use of the Mexican pesos and that such subjective factors are not properly considered in the hypothetical, willing buyer/willing seller scenario that typically governs a determination of fair market value. We disagree.

The restrictions relating to petitioner\rquote s and to Procesos\rquote  access and use of the Mexican pesos and to certain class B stock in Procesos were consistent with the overall purpose and objective of each party to the transaction. They were consistent with the business objectives of each party. In our judgment, as we stated in our prior opinion, they were not significantly different from restrictions commonly placed by financial institutions on loan proceeds and on startup companies in disbursing loan proceeds relating to construction loans or project financing.

Petitioner and the amici curiae cite numerous cases in support of their argument that a fair market valuation of property generally should not take into account subjective factors (such as the intended use of the property). Properly read, however, the cases cited do not stand for the proposition that all subjective elements in a transaction (such as the intent of the parties and the purpose for the transaction) should be disregarded in determining fair market value. Rather, the cases cited stand for the limited proposition that blatantly self-serving, subjective testimony and evidence offered in an attempt, after the fact, to revalue a transaction contrary to its recognized market value will be rejected.

 to petitioner than pesos that petitioner could have obtained on the open market because there were attached to these pesos special, pre-approved business opportunities for petitioner in Mexico and because the pesos carried with them an interest rate that protected petitioner from risks associated with inflation in Mexico and with fluctuations in the US$/Mex$ exchange rate. The so-called \u8220\'3frestrictions\u8221\'3f attached to the pesos involved in this transaction, therefore, in this respect served as enhancements to the value of the pesos.

Respondent acknowledges provisions of the Restructure Agreement that place some limitations on assignment of Mexican Government debt, but respondent notes that none of these provisions applies to a transfer or assignment of the debt, nor to the transfer or assignment of a participation therein, by a bank domiciled in the United States. Respondent also notes that under New York case law any prohibition on assignment must be express.

The vague limitations on transferability of Mexican Government debt on which petitioner relies are largely meaningless in this case. Under the Debt Participation and Capitalization Agreement and the Restructure Agreement, the Mexican Government expressly consented to the transfer of its US$1,200,000 debt, or of a \u8220\'3fparticipation\u8221\'3f therein, to petitioner. The Mexican Government thereby is to be regarded as having waived whatever restrictions generally would have applied to such a transfer of Mexican Government debt to petitioner.

Similarly, the argument must be rejected that any ownership interest or participation of petitioner in the debt occurred for such a momentary period of time that such interest or participation should be disregarded. It was petitioner\rquote s provision of the US$600,000 that caused the NMB Bank to relinquish the US$1,200,000 Mexican Government debt -- hardly an economic fact that we can ignore.

Petitioner did not transfer US$600,000 to the Mexican Government. Rather, petitioner provided those U.S. dollars to a commercial bank in exchange for U.S. dollar-denominated debt of the Mexican Government with a face amount of US $1,200,000. Petitioner then exchanged not the US$600,000 in cash but the US $1,200,000 Mexican Government debt for Mex$1,736,694,000. As a further, significant element of the transaction, petitioner was also given Mexican governmental permission to construct a lambskin processing plant in Mexico, and petitioner was provided pesos at a very favorable exchange rate. The Mexican Government was relieved of its US$1,200,000 debt without using its limited supply of U.S. dollars, and it obtained a commitment that the Mexican pesos it provided would stay in Mexico.
