In determining taxable income of corporate taxpayer that was major online retailer, IRS abused its discretion in using expert\rquote s discounted cash-flow (DCF) method to calculate amount of arm\rquote s-length buy-in payment that taxpayer\rquote s European subsidiary was required to make to taxpayer for transfer of intangible property pursuant to qualified cost sharing arrangement (QCSA); expert improperly assumed perpetual useful life for intangibles that had useful life of about seven years, he improperly included in buy-in payment the value of subsequently developed intangibles, and he employed an enterprise valuation that swept into his calculation assets that were not transferred under QCSA and assets that were not compensable intangibles to begin with, such as goodwill.

In determining taxable income of corporate taxpayer that was major online retailer, IRS abused its discretion in determining that 100% of taxpayer\rquote s technology and content costs constituted ongoing intangible development costs (IDCs) for which taxpayer\rquote s European subsidiary was required to pay taxpayer pursuant to qualified cost sharing arrangement (QCSA); substantial non\u8211\'3fIDCs were captured in taxpayer\rquote s technology and content costs.

On the first issue, petitioner originally reported a buy-in payment from AEHT of $254.5 million, to be paid over seven years. In determining the value of the transferred assets, petitioner assumed that each group of assets (website technology, marketing intangibles, and customer information) had a seven-year useful life.

In respondent\rquote s view, the transferred property had an indeterminate useful life, and it had to be valued, not as three distinct groups of assets, but as integrated components of an operating business. Applying a discounted cash-flow (DCF) methodology to the expected cash flows from the European business, the IRS determined a buy-in payment of $3.6 billion, later reduced to $3.468 billion.

Amazon is committed to continuous growth in the number and variety of products it offers for sale. With a view to increasing selection further, Amazon in 2000 began allowing third parties to sell items on its websites. Amazon made available a set of eCommerce platforms, services, and tools that enabled third parties to list their own products and services for sale on Amazon.com and related websites. This branch of Amazon\rquote s business was called Marketplace. Through Marketplace, third-party merchants set their own prices for their products and services, which appeared alongside the products that Amazon itself sold. Amazon received commissions on these third-party sales and recorded the commission amounts (not the sale prices) as revenue.

Some third parties desired to use Amazon\rquote s technology but did not wish to sell their products on an Amazon-branded website. To meet this demand, Amazon built and operated eCommerce websites, custom made for a particular merchant, through which that merchant could make online sales of its products under its own brand name. This branch of Amazon\rquote s business was called Merchants.com or M.com. Whereas Marketplace retailers sold items on Amazon\rquote s websites, M.com retailers sold items on their own branded websites, which were built by Amazon using the entire suite of eCommerce technology that ran Amazon\rquote s own websites. Although Amazon built websites for numerous customers, the most successful implementation of its M.com business was the website it built for Target Corp., which enabled Target to sell its retail products through Target.com.

Since its founding Amazon has committed itself to the \u8220\'3fthree pillars\u8221\'3f of selection, price, and convenience. Under the selection pillar Amazon aims to offer its customers the widest possible selection by ensuring continuous growth in the number and variety of products offered. Under the price pillar Amazon endeavors to keep its prices as low as possible at all times. The convenience pillar encompasses a range of goals associated with improving the customer experience, including: (1) helping customers find what they seek as quickly as possible; (2) delivering to them as quickly and accurately as possible all items that they purchase; and (3) ensuring that potential customers have all information useful

In April 1998 Amazon acquired Bookpages, Ltd., an online bookstore in the UK, and Telebook, Inc., an online bookstore in Germany. Later that year Amazon re-launched these websites under the respective domain names Amazon.co.uk and Amazon.de. In August 2000 Amazon launched its French business organically rather than by acquisition, adopting the domain name Amazon.fr. At the outset, Amazon.co.uk and Amazon.de offered only books; Amazon.fr offered books, music, and video products. During the tax years at issue, Germany, the UK, and France were the only European countries in which Amazon operated.

By 1999 Amazon.co.uk, Amazon.de, and Amazon.com had become the three most popular online retail domains in Europe. By 2005 Amazon\rquote s share of total online retail spending approached or exceeded double digits in Germany and the UK, while lagging in France. In each country, however, Internet retailing was a small fraction of the overall retail market segment. By one account, Internet sales in 2005 represented only 2.4%, 5.6%, and 1.1% respectively of total retail spending in Germany, the UK, and France.

Although all three nations were EU members, the manner in which Amazon operated its business in each country was in many respects local. A local country manager supervised a staff with responsibility for vendor and customer relationships, fulfillment, pricing, and financial management. Due to differing cultural preferences, retail traditions, and national regulations, the details of these operations\u8212\'3fand the technology required to make them happen\u8212\'3foften varied from country to country.

As of January 1, 2005, vendors and the terms on which they sold goods to Amazon differed in each country. Local Amazon employees in each country identified and recruited vendors; this recruitment process was intensely personal and could take years. For example, although Canon is a multinational corporation selling cameras throughout the world, each of Amazon\rquote s European subsidiaries had to negotiate

 separately with the Canon team in its country, and those Canon teams had distinct organizations, pricing policies, and sources of supply. Similar variations existed in the Marketplace program: Local teams speaking the local language identified and recruited prospective Marketplace sellers in each country. As of January 1, 2005, even the largest of Amazon\rquote s vendors and merchants transacted with its European subsidiaries at the local level, rather than transacting with Amazon on a global or pan-European basis.

Pricing in Europe was also local. Amazon endeavored to offer the best value for customers, which meant matching or beating local prices, both online and offline. But prevailing prices for a given item could vary considerably from country to country on account of such factors as: (1) unique local competitors and competitive environments; (2) different vendors with different pricing policies; and (3) local laws and regulations that restricted pricing (e.g., by preventing discounting on books and other items). In order to match competitors\rquote  prices, each European subsidiary first had to determine which companies it would treat as competitors; this was a local decision because the markets were all different. Each subsidiary then sent teams of local employees to check prices by visiting competitors\rquote  stores.

Local factors also affected the fulfillment process, that is, the mechanics of preparing an order for shipment and effecting timely delivery to the customer. As of January 1, 2005, each European subsidiary filled orders from an in-country fulfillment center; if a French warehouse was short of an item, delivery could be delayed even if UK warehouses had ample supply. Amazon\rquote s UK and German fulfillment centers used a \u8220\'3fbuffer rebin sortation process\u8221\'3f that was built independently in Europe; it had a fundamentally different design from that used in Amazon\rquote s U.S. and French fulfillment centers. Amazon\rquote s transportation costs and the speed, reliability, and accuracy of its shipping also varied because of local regulations and other economic factors in Germany, the UK, and France.

Surprisingly perhaps, customers\rquote  payment preferences also differed geographically. German customers, for example, used credit cards less frequently than customers in other countries. The German subsidiary thus had to build two unique payment systems for use by its customers: \u8220\'3fdirect debit,\u8221\'3f

 which enabled it to deduct purchase amounts from customers\rquote  bank accounts; and \u8220\'3fpay by invoice,\u8221\'3f which provided customers a bill along with their shipment. German customers were also prone to regard items as having been purchased \u8220\'3fon approval\u8221\'3f and to return items with which they were dissatisfied. This required the German subsidiary to create unique processes to deal with the high volume of returns, which could range up to 50% on certain items.

The idiosyncrasies of local markets tripped up many U.S. retailers seeking to expand into Europe. Best Buy failed in the UK, and Walmart failed in Germany. Amazon itself came close to failing in France; in the early 2000s the French subsidiary was Amazon\rquote s worst performing business. This led to a substantial downsizing in 2004, which required the company to file with French authorities a \u8220\'3fsocial plan\u8221\'3f by which it communicated its downsizing plan and the justification for it.

This intellectual property included the underlying website technology, all of which had been developed in the United States; all of the European customer information; and most of the marketing intangibles, including trademarks and domain names. In 1996, for example, Amazon US registered the \u8220\'3fAmazon\u8221\'3f trademark under Nice classes 9, 37, and 42 in an attempt to protect that mark throughout the EU. As explained more fully below, some of the trademarks and domain names used by the European Subsidiaries were titled in their respective names.

Unlike in the United States, where Amazon operated uniform retail websites serving a large geography with a large population, Amazon\rquote s retail business in Europe had a siloed structure. Each European Subsidiary had a distinct website employing its own national language. Each European Subsidiary had its own fulfillment centers, often processing country-specific inventory, and a distinct universe of customers residing chiefly within its own borders.

 to pan\u8211\'3fEuropean expansion. The European fulfillment centers had inventory management problems and were reaching their physical capacity. Unlike their U.S. counterparts, European fulfillment centers could not freely transfer inventory and could not offload volume from one center to another. The growth of the European business was also stressing Amazon\rquote s website technology: All website servers were in the United States, and increased website traffic exacerbated latency problems. (\u8220\'3fLatency\u8221\'3f refers to the speed with which a webpage loads; customers prefer faster speeds.)

Recognizing that serving European customers through poorly coordinated national silos was inefficient, Amazon during the early 2000s began to investigate creation of a centralized European headquarters. One goal of this process was to enhance customer experience by locating servers closer to customers, thus reducing website latency. Other goals were to place top managers in the same time zones as their customers; to standardize best practices for customer service, traffic generation, pricing, and vendor acquisition; to increase efficiency by minimizing duplicative individual country costs; and to create a pan\u8211\'3fEuropean fulfillment infrastructure that would facilitate expansion into additional EU countries.

Tax issues, including applicable tax rates, also loomed large in Amazon\rquote s thinking. To avoid creating a U.S. permanent establishment, European personnel could not sign contracts or make ultimate business decisions on behalf of Amazon US within Europe. By establishing a European headquarters, Amazon could collect and remit value added tax (VAT) at a single rate in a single jurisdiction (the location of the seller), rather than at multiple rates in multiple jurisdictions (the locations of the buyers). And Amazon was quite aware that the effective marginal rate of corporate income tax was (or could be negotiated to be) significantly lower in certain EU member states\u8212\'3fspecifically, Luxembourg and Ireland\u8212\'3fthan it was in the United States.

In broad outline, Amazon\rquote s plan was to transfer from Amazon US to the Luxembourg headquarters affiliate all of the intangible assets required to operate the European website businesses; to continue using the European Subsidiaries as service companies earning a nominal rate of return; and to have the vast bulk of the income from Amazon\rquote s European businesses taxed in Luxembourg at a very low rate. In pursuit of the latter goal, Amazon successfully negotiated an advance tax agreement with the Government of Luxembourg. After the restructuring, the Luxembourg entity would function as the operational and administrative headquarters for the European businesses and own virtually all of the intangible assets required to operate those businesses.

Beginning in 2004 Amazon undertook a series of transactions, dubbed \u8220\'3fProject Goldcrest,\u8221\'3f to implement this plan. (\u8220\'3fGoldcrest\u8221\'3f refers to Luxembourg\rquote s national bird.) These transactions were complex; they involved many steps and many entities. But the basic outline can be stated fairly succinctly. Amazon US formed AEHT, the Luxembourg headquarters entity that would serve as the holding company for all of the European businesses. AEHT elected to be treated as a corporation for U.S. income tax purposes from the date of its formation.

These functions included holding title to the inventory sold in Europe, licensing Amazon\rquote s intellectual property, housing the servers, and maintaining call centers.

The EFN technology successfully converted a three-country silo structure into a network, leveraging AEHT\rquote s status as Amazon\rquote s single seller of record throughout Europe, which simplified the sharing and pooling of inventory. The EFN technology enabled customers shopping on one national website to view inventory and acquire products housed in fulfillment centers located in other countries. Implementation of this technology significantly reduced the time that customers waited to receive products, reduced shipment costs, lowered product prices, and dramatically increased selection.

The Internet makes consumers\rquote  costs of searching for a product virtually disappear and allows them to switch from one retailer to another by clicking a mouse. A theory called \u8220\'3fstickiness\u8221\'3f posits that a consumer usually will not switch to a competitor after a single bad experience on a particular site.

Innovative technology underlies every aspect of Amazon\rquote s retail business. It is integral to creating and managing the catalog, displaying items in the catalog to potential customers, conveying the look and feel of the websites, convincing a potential customer to buy an item, completing transactions, processing payments, packaging an item, shipping it to the customer, and preventing fraud. To continue to deliver on its promises, Amazon in the mid\u8211\'3f2000s made massive investments to ensure a rapid pace of technological innovation. Respondent\rquote s principal valuation expert, Daniel J.

Amazon\rquote s software engineers, computer scientists, and management team focused on continuous innovation to provide easy-to-use functionality, rich website content, fast and reliable fulfillment, timely customer service, and a trusted transactional environment. Amazon regularly launched software on a test basis, fully conscious of the need for further improvements; its software and website content often changed multiple times the same day. Amazon\rquote s software development process \u8220\'3fleveraged the future\u8221\'3f: By building a piece of software quickly, Amazon incurred the risk that it would not be adaptable to future needs.

These challenges were especially pronounced during Amazon\rquote s peak holiday seasons, when webpage views, transactions consummated, and products packaged increased by 300% to 400% over nonpeak periods. Holiday periods stressed every aspect of Amazon\rquote s system, and each successive peak season entailed higher volumes and thus greater scale challenges. Amazon risked system collapse if its technology could not scale up to these demands.

Determined to address these scale challenges, Amazon made 24\u8211\'3f7 website availability its chief company goal for 2005.

A related factor driving innovation was the need to reduce \u8220\'3flatency.\u8221\'3f During the early 2000s Amazon\rquote s software architecture was built in a siloed fashion that required particular functions to \u8220\'3fcall\u8221\'3f data from databases. As website traffic geometrically increased, more nanoseconds were required to call these data, causing webpages to load more slowly and respond less quickly to customer requests. Amazon believed that website latency frustrated customers, leading them to abandon the page they were viewing or leave Amazon\rquote s site altogether.

Another factor driving innovation was the need to protect customer data and prevent fraud.

It dedicated large teams of software engineers to create innovative security protocols designed to repel cyber-attacks, keep its website up, protect customer information, and maintain customer trust.

The Obidos application was written in \u8220\'3fcatsubst,\u8221\'3f an arcane programming language that Amazon created. Significant engineering effort was required to perform even basic tasks.

Since any change to the Obidos code might affect many applications, a team desiring to modify one application had to get input from multiple engineering groups. This became a cumbersome process.

By 2002 Amazon had moved six services out of Obidos: By reducing the load on Obidos it was able to handle a higher volume of web traffic. Although Amazon\rquote s chief technology officer declared in 2005 that the Obidos architecture had reached its \u8220\'3fend of life\u8221\'3f in 2001, 98% of Amazon\rquote s retail webpages still ran on Obidos as of January 2005. By May of that year there was real concern that Amazon\rquote s website would not be able to scale through the holiday season if it continued to run on Obidos. Great effort was expended to move a significant amount of traffic off Obidos and onto a service-oriented architecture known as Gurupa. Amazon transitioned rapidly away from Obidos during 2005 and ceased using it altogether on August 31, 2006.

Amazon began its shift toward a service-oriented architecture around 2002. \u8220\'3fService-oriented architecture\u8221\'3f describes software designed as a set of small, independent programs or \u8220\'3fservices\u8221\'3f; the services work together to perform complex tasks. In this model, each service needs to understand how to interact only with those other functions with which it has actual contact. This differentiates it from a monolithic model, where each function must understand how to interact with every other function in a larger program. Amazon did not invent service-oriented architecture, which was a well-known concept in the computer industry.

Amazon built this new architecture on a Gurupa engine, which received requests from a web server, sent the requests to services or applications, and returned responses to the web server. The engine did not create webpage content; instead, it sent requests to applications that, in coordination with services, created and returned webpage content to the server. The role of the Gurupa engine, in effect, was to stitch together dynamic webpages.

 rewriting software in different programming languages. Amazon decided to abandon catsubst for building webpages and shifted to a programming language known as Perl and a templating language known as Mason (the duo was called \u8220\'3fPerl/Mason\u8221\'3f). Amazon could reuse very little of the Obidos software when it moved to Gurupa. And many concepts that underlay the monolithic architecture were not applicable to a distributed system. Amazon displayed its first Perl/Mason page in August 2005, but very few European webpages were generated using Perl/Mason and Gurupa until 2006.

Problems with the new architecture soon emerged. Webpages created in Perl/Mason and rendered using the Gurupa engine took longer to appear in a user\rquote s browser than comparable Obidos pages. Gurupa\rquote s throughput\u8212\'3fthe number of webpages that could be displayed per second\u8212\'3fwas less than a tenth of Obidos\rquote  in August 2005. One reason was that Gurupa at the time did not support parallel rendering or \u8220\'3fstreaming.\u8221\'3f Rather than loading webpages sequentially, streaming enables different parts of a webpage to be loaded simultaneously, permitting the customer to view part of the page while the rest is being delivered to his or her web browser. Streaming capabilities were increasingly prevalent on Amazon\rquote s competitors\rquote  websites, and their absence at Amazon negatively affected its customers\rquote  shopping experience.

Another problem was that the services called by the Gurupa engine were developed in \u8220\'3fsilos\u8221\'3f rather than as an integrated system. In certain situations, these services suffered from \u8220\'3fcircular dependencies,\u8221\'3f that is, links that eventually connect code back to itself, which can cause the software to crash after a code change. Because of lack of coordination between service \u8220\'3fsilos,\u8221\'3f code was often written that duplicated existing functionality. These structural problems increased as Amazon created new services and expanded its website capabilities.

In September 2006 Amazon hired Brian Valentine to envision and lead the development of a new eCommerce platform. He regarded Gurupa as an unreliable application and put it on \u8220\'3flife support\u8221\'3f shortly after he arrived. He testified that his unit had to devote most of its efforts to \u8220\'3fkeeping the lights on\u8221\'3f\u8212\'3fthat is, keeping Amazon\rquote s websites from crashing on Gurupa\u8212\'3frather than pursuing innovative projects. By 2012 Amazon had migrated most of its website platform from Gurupa to Santana, but it was still using Gurupa for some applications as late as November 2014.

Mr. Valentine\rquote s goal was to create a true technology platform, with a central and standardized set of services and a uniform interface for interacting with those services. A key feature of this platform was Santana, a Java-based web hosting service and rendering engine that addressed Gurupa\rquote s performance and stability problems. Santana was first deployed on an Amazon website in 2007; by 2008 Amazon had chosen Santana as its preferred architecture for future software development projects. This shift to Santana required Amazon to rewrite virtually all of its eCommerce services, and the new platform thus took much longer to build and implement than Amazon had expected.

The new platform was vastly superior to its predecessor. Java was more efficient and performance oriented than Perl/Mason, and it was a modern programming language that made hiring easier. Java reduced the parallel rendering problem that had plagued Gurupa, and it significantly reduced latency. Java was superior for streaming digital content and, in conjunction with Santana, it provided much better throughput.

Launched around 2000, Customer Master Service (CMS) was the first service launched in Amazon\rquote s move toward a service-oriented architecture. CMS initially had limited ambitions, simply allowing customers to change their user names or passwords. As a result of constant revision its functionality was vastly expanded. CMS eventually functioned as a \u8220\'3fbroker\u8221\'3f between the database storing Amazon\rquote s customer information and the various retail segments (e.g., service centers, fulfillment centers, and the website) that needed this customer information.

By fall 2004 CMS had grown very large, complex, and fragile as Amazon\rquote s evolving business requirements necessitated constant changes to the software. CMS became a bottleneck and experienced more than 50 hours of outages during the December 2004 holiday season. To address these problems, Amazon embarked on a complete re-architecture of CMS during 2005 and 2006. At the time of trial, CMS no longer existed, having been replaced by new software known as Identity Service.

\u8220\'3fOrdering\u8221\'3f includes the steps whereby a customer places an order, payment is authorized, a shipment request is prepared, and the order is handed off for fulfillment. This requires interactions with many other parts of Amazon\rquote s software, including the systems managing fraud prevention, payment, sales tax collection, and fulfillment. Amazon developed Order Master Service (OMS) around 2000 to handle key aspects of shopping carts, orders, shipments, and related business logic and messaging. Although it was built outside of Obidos, it resembled Obidos in being a large monolithic program that was difficult to support.

An important component of Amazon\rquote s ordering technology is its much-imitated \u8220\'3fshopping cart,\u8221\'3f which allows customers to save items they intend to purchase in a single location while they continue to shop. Amazon initially stored shopping cart information in an Oracle database. By the end of 2004 Amazon\rquote s overloaded shopping carts were driving the Oracle databases to operate beyond the limits of their capability, causing multi-day outages in 2004. In early 2005 Amazon\rquote s shopping cart had \u8220\'3flow availability,\u8221\'3f which meant that customers could put items in their carts, experience a session crash, and return to find their carts empty. During 2005\u8211\'3f2006 Amazon\rquote s engineers developed a high-availability system called \u8220\'3fDynamo\u8221\'3f to replace the Oracle databases. Dynamo was fully implemented during 2007 and lasted about five years before it needed to be replaced.

Item Master went through three major revisions between 2001 and 2010. By 2004 the software (then in its second version) was encountering scale limitations and lacked functionality that Amazon\rquote s expanding business required. For example, Item Master was unable to identify situations where items listed by different sellers were in fact the same item; this damaged the customer experience by returning multiple search results in response to a query for a single product. To address these and other challenges, Amazon in 2006 began developing a third version of the software, Item Master v3. Item Master v3 rebuilt the process for listing and describing items in the catalog and entailed a substantial rewrite of Item Master v2. Item Master v3 was deployed in 2007 and ran concurrently with Item Master v2 until 2010, when the latter was shut down.

During 2005\u8211\'3f2006, Amazon built and launched a third Similarities engine that engineers described as \u8220\'3fa complete rethinking of the problem\u8221\'3f and \u8220\'3fa total game changer.\u8221\'3f By employing \u8220\'3fvastly more efficient algorithms,\u8221\'3f the new Similarities engine achieved speeds 40 times faster than its predecessor\rquote s. It significantly reduced the time needed to assemble and update Similarities data.

Amazon\rquote s Recommendations software likewise faced algorithmic, scale, and latency challenges. Because Amazon did not know which customers would visit when, the software had to process large volumes of data very rapidly in real time. Its algorithms had to select from and account for a wide variety of inputs in determining exactly which items would be recommended; for example, a purchase of patio furniture years ago would not yield useful recommendations for a customer now shopping for a computer. In an effort to ameliorate latency problems, Amazon rewrote Recommendations between May 2005 and May 2006, reducing its 60,000 lines of code to fewer than 15,000 lines. This redesign significantly improved performance. Because of \u8220\'3fsubstantial changes across every major component\u8221\'3f of the Personalization technology, Amazon\rquote s engineers estimated that the contribution

Once Amazon moved toward a service-oriented architecture, it required \u8220\'3fmessaging\u8221\'3f software to enable the technological components underlying its website to communicate with each other in a unified way. In 2003 Amazon was using commercially available publish-subscribe (or \u8220\'3fpub-sub\u8221\'3f) messaging software supplied by TIBCO, a third party. TIBCO\rquote s messaging service at the time was state-of-the-art, but it was being pushed to its limits by the uniquely heavy performance demands that Amazon was placing upon it.

During the 2003 holiday season, failures in the TIBCO messaging software caused outages that could last hours at a time. In early 2004 Amazon\rquote s engineers expressed concern that introduction of new services could bring down Amazon\rquote s website because of the problems associated with TIBCO messaging software. Cisco Systems, which supplied Amazon with routers and other networking equipment, informed the company that its routers, in conjunction with the TIBCO software, would not support the \u8220\'3fscaling up\u8221\'3f required for the 2004 holiday season.

Amazon Prime is a membership program that enables customers to receive free one-or two-day shipping and discounted overnight shipping along with other benefits. Amazon introduced Prime in the United States in 2005 and in Europe between 2007 and 2008. The Prime program required major changes to the technology used to operate Amazon\rquote s fulfillment centers, especially during peak shopping periods. Items destined for Prime customers had to be picked, sorted, packaged, and shipped in a different manner from other items in order to ensure the expedited delivery that Amazon promised.

In its M.com business, Amazon used the technology that powered its own retail websites to build and operate eCommerce websites for other merchants. Amazon\rquote s principal M.com clients were large retailers doing business in the United States and abroad; there were no material differences between the technology \u8220\'3fpackages\u8221\'3f that domestic and foreign clients received. Amazon\rquote s major clients included Target in the United States, Marks & Spencer in the UK, Mothercare in the UK, and Sears Canada. Amazon\rquote s contract with Target went into effect in 2001 and was initially set to expire in 2006; it was later extended several times via amendments. Amazon eventually decided to terminate the M.com program and shut it down altogether after 2010.

Through the M.com program, Amazon functioned essentially as a supplier of technology to other retailers. Through the Associates and Syndicated Stores programs, Amazon entered into relationships with third parties with the goal of enhancing its own customer base. In both of the latter programs, Amazon paid referral fees to the third party when its customers or website visitors made purchases from Amazon. Both programs were in operation in 2005\u8211\'3f2006; only the Associates program continues to operate today.

 Associates could be online retailers themselves, but more typically they maintain content-specific sites or blogs that offer product reviews or similar information.

Through Syndicated Stores, Amazon used its eCommerce technology to sell Amazon products through a third-party retailer\rquote s website (called the \u8220\'3fmirror site\u8221\'3f). In this scenario Amazon was the merchant making the sale; it kept the associated retail markup and paid a referral fee to the Syndicated Stores partner. Although Amazon derived benefits from Syndicated Stores apart from customer referral\u8212\'3fbecause the partner was usually a web retailer, the program eliminated some competition\u8212\'3fthe fees Amazon paid were essentially payments for customer referrals.

Notwithstanding their differences, petitioner viewed the Associates and Syndicated Stores programs similarly: The primary purpose of both was to drive customers to Amazon. It signed agreements with about 20 Syndicated Stores partners (including European partners) before discontinuing the program. Whereas these agreements were individually negotiated, agreements in the Associates program were not. The process by which an associate joined the program was substantially automated and the compensation terms were fixed and largely nonnegotiable.

The stated commission rates under both programs depended on product mix and sales volumes. Commission rates generally ranged from 4% to 8% in the Associates program and from 4% to 6% in the Syndicated Stores program. Referral fees for Syndicated Stores partners generally had a per-unit cap; this meant that the effective commission rate could be lower than the nominal rate reflected in the contract. Amazon expected that most people referred to it under these programs would be converted into Amazon customers, on whose subsequent purchases no referral fees would be due. It was accordingly willing to pay relatively high upfront commissions for customer referrals. The average referral fee

Petitioner knew that it had a duty to report the Project Goldcrest transactions on its Federal income tax returns. To assist it in discharging this responsibility, it hired Deloitte LLP to calculate the required buy-in payment. In order to do this, Deloitte needed multi-year financial projections for the European business. Given the unpredictability of eCommerce revenue growth, Amazon for internal budgeting purposes did not make financial projections more than 12 or 18 months out. It assigned its tax department the task of creating longer term projections for this occasion.

The tax department started with Amazon\rquote s historical financial data and the most recent income-statement forecast, which included projections for the next 18 months. In consultation with business and finance personnel, the team forecast growth rates for revenue, gross margins, operating expenses, and operating margins for the U.S. and the European businesses. These projections covered calendar years 2005 through 2010.

In selecting their CUTs, both experts also relied on the same sources of public information. But the two experts came to disparate value determinations, chiefly because of very different conclusions as to the useful life of the transferred property and the proper royalty rate to apply over the property\rquote s useful life. Mr. Reilly concluded that the arm\rquote s-length value of the marketing intangibles ranged from $251 million to $312 million; Mr. Haigh determined a value of $3.13 billion for the same intangible property.

The customer information that Amazon US transferred to AEHT consisted of data about European retail customers who had transacted with the European Subsidiaries before May 1, 2006. These data included names, email addresses, phone numbers, purchasing history, and credit card information. Amazon viewed this customer information as having a short useful life: People change their phone numbers and email addresses often, and their buying habits change significantly over time. For its Similarities software, Amazon uses only relatively recent data because it regards older data as having little or no value.

Dr. Wills assumed that AEHT would pay referral fees for only six years, and he discounted the resulting revenue stream at 18%.

The parties\rquote  dispute focuses on the T&C category. Respondent contends that 100% of the costs accumulated in the T&C category constitute IDCs; as a corollary, this would produce a commensurate increase in the percentage of G&A costs allocable to IDCs. Petitioner urges that T&C costs must be allocated between IDCs and other activities \u8220\'3fon a reasonable basis\u8221\'3f and that its allocation formula accomplishes this result.

Broadly speaking, the costs accumulated in the T&C category include expenses related to technological development and website content. According to petitioner\rquote s SEC filings, its T&C category expenses \u8220\'3fconsist principally of payroll and related expenses for employees involved in research and development, including application development, editorial content, merchandising selection, systems and telecommunications support, and costs associated with the systems and telecommunications infrastructure.\u8221\'3f T&C costs included costs associated with acquired website content; payroll and related expenses for employees involved in research, website development, and telecommunications support; and payroll and related expenses for employees involved in category expansion (i.e., expanding Amazon\rquote s product offerings) and buying.

 During 2005\u8211\'3f2006 many employees whose time was captured in T&C cost centers engaged solely in intangible development activity; certain employees engaged solely in other types of activity; and certain employees engaged in both. This diversity of tasks was reflected in their job classifications. All Amazon employees have job codes beginning with a capital letter, one of which is \u8220\'3fT,\u8221\'3f which stands for \u8220\'3fTechnical.\u8221\'3f Most cost centers that rolled up into T&C have a mix of T\u8211\'3fcoded and non\u8211\'3fT\u8211\'3fcoded workers. During the first quarter of 2006, for example, 35 T&C cost centers had no T\u8211\'3fcoded employees; 27 had all T\u8211\'3fcoded employees; and 69 had a mix. On average during 2005\u8211\'3f2006, there were almost as many T&C cost centers with no T\u8211\'3fcoded employees (31.4 cost centers) as there were with all T\u8211\'3fcoded employees (31.9 cost centers).

(These amounts were reported as reimbursed R&E expenses, thus reducing otherwise-allowable deductions.) The cost sharing payment for 2006 was determined using the PwC survey data as described previously. Because the PwC data were not available when petitioner filed its 2005 return, it initially used a different system to determine the 2005 cost sharing payment. It subsequently filed an affirmative claim for 2005, reporting a lower cost sharing payment computed under the methodology used for 2006. By this affirmative claim, petitioner sought to reduce the 2005 cost sharing payment by approximately $59 million, or almost 50%.

Respondent urges that a DCF methodology, as implemented by Dr. Frisch, supplies the best method for determining an arm\rquote s-length buy-in payment, and that the required payment is $3.468 billion. The first question we must answer is whether respondent abused his discretion in making this determination. We conclude that he did.

Pursuant to a QCSA executed in November 1999, Veritas US granted a European subsidiary (Veritas Ireland) the right to use pre-existing intangible property overseas. The assets thus transferred consisted of short-lived technology, including source code for software products to be sold outside the United States, as well as the right to use outside the United States trademarks, trade names, and service marks owned by Veritas US.

Believing that future cash flows, rather than operating income, would yield the best estimate of an appropriate buy-in payment, Dr. Frisch made several adjustments to AEHT\rquote s projected operating income. First, he subtracted the cost sharing payments that AEHT was projected to make to Amazon US under the QCSA. Second, he added back expected depreciation because it involves no outlay of cash. Third, he subtracted AEHT\rquote s projected future capital expenditures. Finally, he made adjustments based on AEHT\rquote s projected working capital.

After estimating AEHT\rquote s future free cash flows, Dr. Frisch moved to step 2 of his analysis: selecting an appropriate discount rate. Generally speaking, the higher the discount rate, the lower the present value of future cash flows. For internal budgeting purposes, Amazon\rquote s treasury department employed a weighted average cost of capital (WACC) of 13%. Using market data, Dr. Frisch concluded that a discount rate of 18% was appropriate.

Finally, to isolate the future cash flows attributable to AEHT\rquote s intangible assets, Dr. Frisch subtracted the value of the tangible assets it owned as of year-end 2004, which he determined to be negative $1.8 million (representing a negative cash position). This yielded a buy-in payment of $3.468 billion ($3.067 billion + $399 million + $1.8 million = $3.468 billion).

We find this argument unpersuasive for many reasons, but it suffices to mention two. First, respondent\rquote s argument proves too much. Whenever related parties enter into a QCSA, they presumably have the \u8220\'3frealistic alternative\u8221\'3f of not entering into a QCSA. From this truism respondent concludes that the buy-in payment must be determined as if the parties had not elected cost sharing but had instead continued to operate the business as they had done previously. This would make the cost sharing election, which the regulations explicitly make available to taxpayers, altogether meaningless.

First, he contends that Dr. Frisch, unlike Dr. Hatch, \u8220\'3fdid not opine or assume that the transferred intangibles had a perpetual life.\u8221\'3f Rather, Dr. Frisch posited that the pre-existing intangibles had an \u8220\'3findefinite\u8221\'3f useful life, in the sense that \u8220\'3ftheir useful lives, and thus their value, are increasingly uncertain over time.\u8221\'3f Regardless of what adjective one employs, Dr. Frisch clearly valued the intangibles as if they would retain value forever, discounting 20 years\rquote  worth of cash flows and then computing a \u8220\'3fterminal value.\u8221\'3f Dr. Frisch admitted on cross-examination that his methodology produced, in mathematical terms, precisely the outcome that would occur if one assumed a perpetual useful life.

Respondent seeks to minimize this error, noting that, after 20 years, Dr. Frisch\rquote s terminal value accounts for a small fraction of his $3.468 billion total.

 This argument is unpersuasive for at least two reasons. First, AEHT was not an empty cash box. The European Subsidiaries, of which AEHT became the parent, had been in business for approximately six years. They had a skilled workforce; they owned tangible and intangible assets; and they had goodwill and going-concern value. When making the European Subsidiary Contribution to AEHT in May 2006, petitioner valued the European Subsidiaries at approximately $196 million.

Second, and more fundamentally, respondent\rquote s argument ignores the fact that AEHT, by making cost sharing payments, became a genuine co-owner of the subsequently developed intangibles that the IDCs financed. Under Dr. Frisch\rquote s approach, AEHT is allowed to subtract from its buy-in obligation an amount equal to the present value of its projected cost sharing payments, i.e, its discounted cost of acquiring the subsequently developed intangibles. But all future European business profits generated by those intangibles, in excess of that cost, would be allocated to Amazon US through the buy-in payment.

As respondent urges, the discounting process by which Dr. Frisch computes the buy-in payment would arguably afford AEHT a limited return on the investment represented by its share of the IDCs. But the regulations simply do not authorize such an artificial cap on the expected returns that AEHT could realize as co-owner of Amazon\rquote s future intangible assets.

Respondent\rquote s and petitioner\rquote s experts agree that the CUT method may reliably be used to value separately the website technology, the marketing intangibles, and the customer information, though they disagree mightily about the outcomes that this method should produce. We conclude that the CUT method provides the best method for determining the fair market value of all three species of intangible property, but we do not wholly agree with the results reached by either party in implementing this approach. Because petitioner has failed to prove that its proposed valuation meets the arm\rquote s-length standard, the Court must determine for itself, with respect to each category of property, the required buy-in payment.

In its M.com business Amazon used the technology that powered its own websites to build and operate eCommerce websites for other merchants. Amazon\rquote s principal M.com clients were large retailers operating in the United States and abroad. There were no material differences between the technology \u8220\'3fpackages\u8221\'3f that domestic and foreign clients received.

To the extent these ancillary services were supplied in addition to the website technology, Dr. Wills concluded that an appropriate adjustment to the headline rate was warranted.

He thus derived royalty rates ranging from 1.4% to 4.4%, with a median of 3.3%. He concluded that AEHT would be entitled to a downward \u8220\'3fvolume adjustment\u8221\'3f because M.com clients with the largest sales volumes paid a lower implied commission rate. Applying a volume adjustment, he came up with a reduced royalty rate ranging from 1.4% to 2.4%. He concluded that no further adjustments were needed to account for differences in geography or profit potential (respondent\rquote s experts accept this latter conclusion).

Dr. Wills then determined a useful life and a decay curve for Amazon\rquote s website technology by relying on the analyses of four of petitioner\rquote s technology experts, Drs. Birman and Alvisi, Parkes, and MacCormack. On the basis of their analyses, he concluded that the website technology had an average useful life of six years but that it would decline in value or \u8220\'3fdecay\u8221\'3f quite rapidly during this period. For example, he concluded that during 2007 the average value of the technology would be 56.1% of its January 1, 2005, value, and that during 2009 its average value would be 24.8% of that initial value.

Dr. Wills multiplied his volume-adjusted royalty rates (ranging from 1.4% to 2.4%) by the decay percentage to generate final royalty rates for each year. Thus, for example, the effective \u8220\'3fhigh\u8221\'3f royalty rate for 2007 was 1.35% (2.4% \u215\'3f .561) and the effective \u8220\'3flow\u8221\'3f royalty rate for 2007 was 0.79% (1.4% \u215\'3f .561). For years after 2010 he added a \u8220\'3ftail\u8221\'3f of 3\u8211\'3f1/2 years, at a flat royalty rate, to account for any \u8220\'3fcontinued presence of some base of code\u8221\'3f after six years.

Dr. Higinbotham selected a base royalty rate of 4%, the headline commission rate appearing in a pre\u8211\'3f2005 M.com agreement between Amazon and Target. Dr. Wills derived his royalty rate from 12 M.com agreements, including the Target agreement. He concluded that it was inappropriate to rely solely on the headline commission rates stated in these agreements because the deals had multiple revenue sources, including ancillary services.

Dr. Wills based the latter conclusion in part on the testimony of Charles Moore, who headed the M.com business during 2005 and 2006. Mr. Moore testified that Amazon did not always expect to earn a profit on the ancillary services standing alone; the headline rate was designed to ensure a reasonable profit on those services as well as compensate Amazon for use of its technology. He further testified that his business team used detailed financial spreadsheets called \u8220\'3fdeal decks\u8221\'3f to analyze the overall economics of an M.com transaction.

The parties agree that the Target arrangement is the most comparable M.com transaction for purposes of implementing the CUT approach. Target was the largest M.com retailer and the most comparable to AEHT in terms of sales volume. Target, like AEHT, had a broad product line and wide product selection. And Target was contractually entitled to receive from Amazon US all technology updates as they occurred. But the Target agreement was not comparable in one major respect: It included a variety of ancillary services, such as fulfillment and customer service, that Amazon US did not provide to AEHT.

 Target and Amazon executed their original M.com agreement on August 31, 2001. Target thereby agreed to pay commissions, computed on revenues derived from its website sales, of 5% during 2001\u8211\'3f2002, 4.5% during 2003, and 4% during 2004\u8211\'3f2006. This agreement was amended twice before 2006 (once in August 2003 and again in August 2005); both amendments retained the 4% headline commission rate for 2004\u8211\'3f2006. The agreement was amended a third time in July 2006, about 18 months after Amazon US and AEHT executed the CSA. This final amendment replaced the 4% rate with a tiered commission structure based on sales volumes; it also included a dollar cap on the amount of commissions that Target was required to pay.

We disagree with Dr. Higinbotham\rquote s exclusive reliance on the 4% headline rate set forth in the original Target agreement. He acknowledged on cross-examination that the \u8220\'3fholistic\u8221\'3f pricing of the M.com agreements posed an impediment to relying solely on the stated commission rate. And he conceded that the \u8220\'3fdeal decks\u8221\'3f should be afforded more weight than he gave them in determining projected revenue flows. Thus, while Dr. Higinbotham properly considered the version of the Target agreement in effect when the CSA was executed, his analysis suffered from reliance on a headline rate that included pricing for ancillary services as well as website technology.

Nonetheless, we find that the Target agreements do bracket the range of acceptable royalty rates. From the agreement in effect on January 1, 2005, we conclude that a royalty rate adjusted to back out ancillary service revenue should be meaningfully below 4%. And from the agreement in effect in July 2006, which was designed to reduce Target\rquote s commission obligation, we conclude the proper base royalty rate should be meaningfully above 2.05%.

Since the Target agreements provide an imperfect comparable, we expand our analysis to include the other M.com agreements. Dr. Higinbotham reviewed 15 M.com agreements; he noted that no agreement had a \u8220\'3fheadline\u8221\'3f commission rate below 3% and concluded that these agreements yielded a royalty rate range of 3% to 5%. Analyzing the \u8220\'3fholistic\u8221\'3f pricing of the 12 M.com agreements with \u8220\'3fdeal decks,\u8221\'3f Dr. Wills determined a royalty rate range of 1.4% to 4.4%, with a median rate of 3.3%.

Evaluating all the evidence, we conclude that an arm\rquote s-length base royalty rate for the website technology, before applying any volume adjustment, is 3.3%. We find this rate acceptable because it properly backs out revenues attributable to ancillary services; it is the median rate determined by Dr. Wills; it is within Dr. Higinbotham\rquote s range; and it is near the midpoint of the commission rates bracketed by the various Target agreements.

We next must decide whether to apply a downward \u8220\'3fvolume adjustment\u8221\'3f to the 3.3% base royalty rate. Dr. Wills noted that the sales volumes expected to be generated by AEHT were \u8220\'3fsubstantially larger\u8221\'3f than the sales volumes generated by any of the 12 comparable M.com retailers, including Target. He found it \u8220\'3fclear from even a casual inspection of the data that there is a negative correlation between the commission rate and the associated sales volume,\u8221\'3f noting Mr. Moore\rquote s testimony that \u8220\'3f[v]olume impacted deal pricing pretty significantly.\u8221\'3f Dr. Higinbotham agreed that this \u8220\'3fnegative correlation\u8221\'3f existed and that AEHT\rquote s projected sales volumes were substantially larger than the median sales volume of the 12 M.com retailers that Dr. Wills surveyed.

 We believe that some volume adjustment is required. But we find that Dr. Wills erred in applying a volume adjustment as large as 200 basis points (e.g., reducing the royalty rate at the high end of his range from 4.4% to 2.4%). Dr. Wills initially attempted to quantify a \u8220\'3fvolume differential\u8221\'3f using a statistical analysis, but he found this approach unreliable (e.g., because it yielded negative implied royalty rates in some cases).

{\b0 \cf19 \f2 \ul0 \strike0 \i0 \fs20 \sa0 \sb0 
 He then made a \u8220\'3fjudgment call\u8221\'3f and estimated a 200\u8211\'3fbasis-point adjustment. He admitted that he had no authority for this particular estimate and that it was not \u8220\'3fvery scientific.\u8221\'3f We agree with that assessment.

As of January 1, 2005, the Target agreement specified a flat commission rate of 4% on sales. No explicit volume adjustment was incorporated into that agreement until July 2006. The parties initially agreed, moreover, that the commission rate would remain at 4% for the period beginning January 1, 2004, and ending on December 31, 2006. Since the volume of Target\rquote s website sales was expected to increase substantially during this three-year period, the Target agreement provides inconclusive support for a volume adjustment or its appropriate size.

The other three M.com agreements were executed after January 1, 2005. The Mothercare agreement specified a commission rate starting at 1% on the lowest tranche of website sales. This rate increased to 3.75% when annual sales hit a certain volume, then decreased to a flat rate of 3.0% when annual sales exceeded \u163\'3f80 million.

Review of these four agreements confirms our conclusion that Dr. Wills\rquote  200\u8211\'3fbasis-point downward adjustment is unwarranted. But the agreements do not yield a mathematical formula for calculating a proper volume adjustment. Indeed, each agreement could conceivably be read to suggest a flat commission rate at the very large sales volumes that AEHT was expected to generate, which would imply at best a modest downward adjustment. Dr. Higinbotham agreed that a volume adjustment would not be illogical, while offering no opinion as to what an appropriate adjustment would be. Using our best judgment as applied to the evidence and testimony as a whole, we conclude that a 25\u8211\'3fbasis-point adjustment is appropriate. After application of that adjustment, we conclude that an arm\rquote s-length royalty rate payable by AEHT for the website technology made available under the CSA is 3.05% (3.30%\u8211\'3f0.25%).

 Drs. Birman and Alvisi adopted a qualitative approach to this problem by considering the major technological improvements (as distinct from ordinary maintenance and routine extensions) that the website technology, as it existed in January 2005, would need in the near future. They identified eight looming issues that Amazon would be required to address, including messaging technology, scaling issues, shopping cart database outages, and problems with Dynamo, Obidos and Gurupa. Given the magnitude of these problems, Drs. Birman and Alvisi concluded that a reasonable useful life for the website technology was three to five years.

Dr. Parkes conducted a somewhat similar ex ante analysis and a more quantitative ex post analysis. In his ex ante analysis, he examined the challenges (in terms of scaling, code complexity, low-quality functionality, and other problems) confronting eight major software components (Application Engine; Catalog; Merchandising; Search/Browse; Ordering; Payments/Fraud/Identity; Pricing; and Fulfillment) as of January 1, 2005. He examined the information compiled by Amazon\rquote s engineers as of that date to assess their likely expectations as to how long this software would last. He determined on the basis of this analysis that a useful life of two to five years could reasonably have been anticipated.

For his ex post analysis, Dr. Parkes evaluated the degree to which the eight software components listed above were actually modified over time. For each year after 2005, he assigned to each component a rating of 1, 2, 3, or 4, depending on whether it remained essentially the same as in January 2005, had source code in development that would replace it, had been substantially modified, or had been replaced altogether. On the basis of this numerical rating system, Dr. Parkes opined that any \u8220\'3fmeaningful contribution\u8221\'3f of Amazon\rquote s January 2005 website technology had disappeared after six years.

Dr. MacCormack performed a quantitative ex post analysis that examined actual changes to source code. He employed two metrics\u8212\'3fcomponent changes and architectural or \u8220\'3fdependency\u8221\'3f changes\u8212\'3fto measure the relative contribution of the original source code (i.e., source code in existence in January 2005) for each year through 2013. Component changes measured the share that the original source code represented of operative source code at later dates. Architectural

 changes, an alternative measure of software evolution, captured the extent to which \u8220\'3fdependencies\u8221\'3f among source files changed over time. On the basis of this quantitative analysis, Dr. MacCormack concluded that a useful life of six years or less was reasonable, noting that \u8220\'3fa substantial portion\u8221\'3f of the source code remaining after six years was \u8220\'3fdormant or commoditized.\u8221\'3f

Amazon\rquote s website architecture was undergoing rapid change as of January 2005. It had become clear that Obidos, the original monolithic architecture, would not last much longer given the \u8220\'3fscaling\u8221\'3f demands that Amazon faced. Amazon attempted to solve these problems by gradually shifting work off Obidos and moving to a distributed system called Gurupa. By January 2005 the move to Gurupa was well underway, yet Obidos was not completely shut down until August 31, 2006. Gurupa was plagued by latency issues; by 2012 Amazon had migrated most of its website platform from Gurupa to Santana, but it was still using Gurupa for some applications as late as November 2014. The evolution of Amazon\rquote s website architecture thus reveals a pattern of continuity amid change: Elements of Obidos and Gurupa each persisted for nine years or more while Amazon was transitioning to its new platform.

In sum, the evidence clearly establishes that Amazon\rquote s website technology did not have a perpetual or \u8220\'3findefinite\u8221\'3f useful life, and we reject respondent\rquote s contention that it did. Dr. Wills\rquote  estimate of a six-year useful life comes close to the mark, but we think his estimate gives insufficient weight to the persistence of Obidos and Gurupa architectural elements, some of which survived nine years or more. Using our best judgment as applied to the evidence and testimony as a whole, we conclude that Amazon\rquote s website technology\u8212\'3fignoring the \u8220\'3ftail\u8221\'3f discussed more fully below\u8212\'3fhad on average a useful life of seven years.

Dr. Wills used decay curves prepared by Drs. Parkes and MacCormack to \u8220\'3framp down,\u8221\'3f over the useful life of the website technology, the royalty rate that AEHT would be required to pay. Petitioner contends that this \u8220\'3framp down\u8221\'3f is necessary to correlate the buy-in payment to the value of the pre-existing intangibles. The website technology in existence in January 2005 gradually declined in value as major components were modified or replaced, and AEHT paid for the replacement technology with ongoing cost sharing payments. We agree that an uncontrolled taxpayer in AEHT\rquote s position would insist that its royalty payments decline ratably with the decline in value of the original technology.

Respondent first contends that no \u8220\'3framp down\u8221\'3f at all is required, noting that \u8220\'3f[n]one of the M.com agreements had declining royalties based on obsolescence of licensed technology.\u8221\'3f That observation is correct, but immaterial. All of Amazon\rquote s M.com clients received technology updates for free; they paid a constant royalty rate for the package of pre-existing and subsequently developed intangibles. AEHT, by contrast, did not receive technology updates for free, but made cost sharing payments by which it became a co-owner of the subsequently developed intangibles.

 by a simple example. Suppose that 1,000 lines of code existed in January 2005; that 500 of those lines still existed in January 2010; and that 1,000 new lines of code had been written in the interim. Dr. MacCormack would find that the \u8220\'3frelative contribution\u8221\'3f of the original source code, as of January 2010, was 33% (500 \u247\'3f 1,500). Employing this analysis on an ex post basis to actual code changes from 2005 through 2013, Dr. MacCormack calculated the following decay curves:

 Dr. Wills examined the decay curves prepared by Drs. Parkes and MacCormack. Reasonably adopting a conservative approach, he accepted for each year the decay percentage that revealed the slowest rate of change from the previous year. Dr. Wills accordingly derived the following decay curve:

Assuming arguendo that some \u8220\'3framp down\u8221\'3f is appropriate, respondent challenges Dr. Wills\rquote  decay curve principally by disputing the methodology that Dr. MacCormack used to measure changes to source code. Whereas Dr. MacCormack employed a \u8220\'3frelative contribution\u8221\'3f approach in evaluating changes to source code, Geoff Cohen, one of respondent\rquote s experts, adopted a \u8220\'3fpersistence\u8221\'3f approach. Source code \u8220\'3fpersistence\u8221\'3f measures the extent to which source code existing in year 1 continues to exist, or \u8220\'3fpersist,\u8221\'3f in subsequent years.

 The difference between the \u8220\'3frelative contribution\u8221\'3f and \u8220\'3fpersistence\u8221\'3f approaches may be illustrated by the example used previously. Suppose that 1,000 lines of code existed in January 2005; that 500 of those lines still existed in January 2010; and that 1,000 new lines of code had been written in the interim. Dr. MacCormack would find that the \u8220\'3frelative contribution\u8221\'3f of the original source code, as of January 2010, was 33% (500 \u247\'3f 1,500).

 By contrast, Dr. Cohen would find that the \u8220\'3fpersistence\u8221\'3f of the original source code, as of January 2010, was 50% (500 \u247\'3f 1,000). It can be seen that the essential difference between these approaches concerns the denominator of the fraction.

Predictably, Dr. Cohen\rquote s \u8220\'3fpersistence\u8221\'3f analysis yielded much slower rates of decay than the \u8220\'3frelative contribution\u8221\'3f analyses of petitioner\rquote s experts. Dr. Cohen determined, for example, that more than half of Amazon\rquote s source code in development or deployed in January 2005 was still deployed in January 2013, and that 36% of the dependencies that Dr. MacCormack identified as of January 2005 still existed in January 2013.

We reject Dr. Cohen\rquote s \u8220\'3fpersistence\u8221\'3f approach for the same reason that we have rejected other aspects of respondent\rquote s valuation: It fails to eliminate from the buy-in payment the value of subsequently developed intangibles. In terms of lines of code, Amazon\rquote s code base grew by about 400% from January 2005 to January 2011, representing an annual growth rate between 23% and 28%. New code and new technologies accounted for 93% of the code base by 2012, and AEHT paid for this new technology through cost sharing payments. In determining the extent to which the January 2005 technology had decayed in value, the relevant question is the extent to which that original technology contributed to the \u8220\'3fstock\u8221\'3f of technology required to operate AEHT\rquote s websites in each subsequent year.

Petitioner\rquote s experts answer that question correctly, under their \u8220\'3frelative contribution\u8221\'3f analysis, by using as the denominator of each fraction the code base existing in each subsequent year. By using as the denominator of each fraction the historical code base existing in January 2005, respondent\rquote s \u8220\'3fpersistence\u8221\'3f approach substantially understates the true rate of decay and in effect requires AEHT to pay for the subsequently developed intangibles twice, once via cost sharing

Respondent raises a second challenge to petitioner\rquote s decay curve, which again focuses on the denominator of the fraction. Dr. MacCormack included in his denominators every line of source code existing on the relevant date, including files that may have been generated automatically by a computer (such as \u8220\'3fXML,\u8221\'3f \u8220\'3farff,\u8221\'3f and other file extensions). Dr. MacCormack\rquote s denominators also included files relating principally to presentation of webpage content (such as \u8220\'3fhtml\u8221\'3f and \u8220\'3fxsl\u8221\'3f).

Dr. Cohen opined that the lines of code thus produced should be eliminated from the denominator. A single computer-generated file can have tens of thousands of lines, many of which contain only data as opposed to meaningful instructions. In Dr. Cohen\rquote s view, it is inappropriate to equate these lines of code, for measurement purposes, to lines of code written by a programmer or software engineer. Dr. Cohen noted that code written to generate presentation content concerns the \u8220\'3flook and feel\u8221\'3f of the website as opposed to its functional operation. Because these lines of code are typically written by \u8220\'3fpainters\u8221\'3f rather than \u8220\'3fplumbers,\u8221\'3f he opined that they should likewise be excluded from the denominators.

We agree with Dr. Cohen on both counts. On the basis of his critique, Dr. Cohen recalculated Dr. MacCormack\rquote s \u8220\'3frelative contribution\u8221\'3f percentages by eliminating from the denominators the lines of code described above. This generated modified versions of Dr. MacCormack\rquote s decay curves, as follows:

 In sum, we agree with petitioner that the royalty rate for the website technology must be ramped down over its seven-year useful life on a decay curve. We also agree with Dr. Wills in accepting for each year, from among the decay curves the experts have supplied, the decay percentage that reveals the slowest rate of change from the previous year. However, we will substitute for Dr. MacCormack\rquote s original decay curves the modified curves, set forth in the previous paragraph, reflecting Dr. Cohen\rquote s critique. Applying Dr. Wills\rquote  approach to the available decay curves as thus modified, we calculate, for the seven-year useful life of the website technology, ramped-down royalty rates as follows:

Dr. Wills recognized that Amazon\rquote s website technology retained value following the useful-life period he posited. Indeed, as shown in the table above, the technology had non-trivial value left at year-end 2011. Dr. Wills accounted for this value by adding to the useful-life period a \u8220\'3ftail\u8221\'3f of three and a half years, during which AEHT was to pay a flat annual royalty of 0.2%. We agree that a \u8220\'3ftail\u8221\'3f period is appropriate, but we find that it should bear a higher royalty rate.

We agree with respondent to some extent.

On the other hand, the evidence established that Amazon reused earlier code to a limited degree, prioritizing speed of innovation over software reuse. Its engineers would often start over, more or less from scratch, when building new architecture or services. This was attributable in part to Amazon\rquote s high turnover rates: Later hired engineers often found their predecessors\rquote  coding difficult to understand and preferred a fresh start.

The switch to new software languages posed another impediment to reusing old code. During the transition from Obidos to Gurupa, Amazon abandoned catsubst (an arcane programming language it created) and shifted to Perl/Mason for building webpages.

{\b0 \cf19 \f2 \ul0 \strike0 \i0 \fs20 \sa0 \sb0 
Amazon could reuse very little of the Obidos software when it moved to Gurupa. Amazon subsequently abandoned Perl/Mason, a \u8220\'3fdying\u8221\'3f language unfamiliar to the next generation of programmers; again much pre-existing source code was discarded. This tendency applied not only to coding but also to concepts: Many concepts that underlay the monolithic Obidos architecture were inapplicable to a distributed system.

Many aspects of Amazon\rquote s technology, moreover, were completely novel and could not rely extensively on pre-existing concepts or ways of working. Kindle, Fire TV, Fire smartphones, cloud computing, and cloud storage were created and marketed after Project Goldcrest was completed.

We thus confront a dilemma similar to others we face in this case. Respondent plausibly contends that the \u8220\'3ftail\u8221\'3f proposed by Dr. Wills may not capture the full residual value of the website technology transferred under the CSA. But respondent\rquote s alternative is to insist that the technology has a perpetual useful life; we have rejected that argument, and respondent\rquote s experts have not offered a coherent formula for calculating a revised \u8220\'3ftail\u8221\'3f period. That being so, we will accept as appropriate the 3\u8211\'3f1/2\u8211\'3fyear \u8220\'3ftail\u8221\'3f period proposed by Dr. Wills.

We conclude, however, that the 0.20% royalty proposed by Dr. Wills for this \u8220\'3ftail\u8221\'3f period is too low. He chose that rate by \u8220\'3fstepping down\u8221\'3f from the 0.27% rate that he used for the final year of the technology\rquote s useful life. We have determined that the appropriate royalty rate for the final year of the technology\rquote s useful life is 0.54%, or twice as high.

We find several flaws in Dr. Higinbotham\rquote s approach. The \u8220\'3fgoodwill impairment\u8221\'3f model on which he relied was developed by a new employee in Amazon\rquote s accounting department. This employee testified that he was then in his orientation period; that he was given the prior year\rquote s model and told to \u8220\'3fmark it up\u8221\'3f; and that he spent his first few weeks at Amazon learning how the model worked by plugging in different variables.

Dr. Frisch and Mr. Haigh (in his opening report) assumed that AEHT\rquote s post\u8211\'3f2011 revenues would grow at annual rates between 3.8% and 4%; Dr. Higinbotham assumed that AEHT\rquote s post\u8211\'3f2011 revenues would grow at annual rates ranging from a high of 22.5% to a low of 8%. We accordingly reject Dr. Higinbotham\rquote s approach and accept the post\u8211\'3f2011 revenues determined by Dr. Wills.

 A final question concerns the starting date for AEHT\rquote s royalty payments. The CSA was effective as of January 1, 2005, and AEHT made cost sharing payments starting as of that date. But the \u8220\'3fbusiness transfer\u8221\'3f did not occur until May 1, 2006, and AEHT earned no gross revenues (attributable to Amazon\rquote s website business or otherwise) before that date.

We concur in the consensus that these two experts reached. Indeed, no expert for either side opined that AEHT should be required to pay royalties for the website technology for any period before May 1, 2006. Because an unrelated third party would not pay royalties until it actually began earning income from the European website business, the starting date for payment of royalties is May 1, 2006.

Petitioner contends, with strong support from its experts, that monthly data more accurately measure Amazon\rquote s volatility compared to the overall market. According to Dr. Unni: \u8220\'3fWhile weekly measurements of returns provide more data points, it skews the measurement of Amazon\rquote s beta downwards because serial correlations in stock returns, which distort the measurement of beta, are pronounced when the returns interval is as short as a week, but are substantially less evident with a returns interval of a month.\u8221\'3f Leading finance textbooks and important scholarly articles use five years of monthly stock market data to calculate a company\rquote s beta.

Applying a discount rate of 13.3% to an assumed revenue base, he calculated in his opening report a value of $1.8 billion for the marketing intangibles. Adopting even higher revenue assumptions in his rebuttal report, he valued the marketing intangibles at $3.13 billion. Respondent contends that this figure should not be reduced to account for prior ownership of any marketing intangibles by the European Subsidiaries.

While the parties\rquote  experts have adopted similar approaches, they disagree on five major inputs into the CUT valuation: (1) the proper royalty rate; (2) the useful life of the marketing intangibles; (3) the revenue base to which the royalty should be applied; (4) the appropriate discount rate; and (5) the extent (if any) to which the buy-in payment must be adjusted to reflect the European Subsidiaries\rquote  prior ownership of certain marketing intangibles.

Both experts selected the Sports Authority Michigan license as a comparable but derived different royalty rates from it. That agreement specified a royalty rate starting in 2003 at 1.2% and declining annually to 0.5% in 2015. Whereas Mr. Haigh selected the starting rate (1.2%), Mr. Reilly took the simple average (0.85%) of all rates in the agreement. Mr. Reilly\rquote s choice was reasonable because the rate during most years of the initial term was 0.8%; Mr.

\u8226\'3f The Kmart trademark was licensed in 1994 by Kmart US to Kmart New Zealand and Kmart Australia, both of which were then owned by an unrelated party. The Kmart brand was also in decline: Many of its US stores were outdated and in decaying condition, and by the 1990s the press labeled Kmart a \u8220\'3f \u8216\'3fdiscount store dud\u8217\'3f in need of revitalization.\u8221\'3f Perhaps for that reason, the royalty rates specified in these agreements (0.125% and 0.188%) are extremely low by comparison with the others. Petitioner has failed to convince us that these two (substantially similar) agreements furnish reliable comparables.

We agree with Mr. Reilly that this agreement is noncomparable for three reasons. First, \u8220\'3fit covers the rights to use trademarks to manufacture, brand, and sell physical products,\u8221\'3f whereas Amazon\rquote s marketing intangibles do not convey such rights. Second, this license agreement was executed as part of a litigation settlement; the parties\rquote  relative bargaining power is unclear, and the royalty rate may reflect other concessions. Third, the agreement\rquote s pricing provisions are complex; Mr. Haigh admitted that the actual royalty rate could be as low as 0.56% under certain conditions, well below the 2% headline rate. For all these reasons, respondent has failed to convince us that this agreement furnishes a reliable comparable

First, most of the products it covered were high-margin jewelry items; AEHT was not a high-margin retailer, and an unrelated party in its position would consider that fact in determining whether to pay a royalty as high as 2%.

 Second, the parties to this agreement were almost related: General Electric, through its NBC subsidiary, owned a significant stake in ValueVision, and SNAP! became a wholly owned subsidiary of NBC one month later. Third, NBC in 2001 announced a rebranding strategy and \u8220\'3feffectively terminated the Snap trademark license [agreement].\u8221\'3f In effect, therefore, the SNAP! agreement was a dead letter when the CSA was executed in January 2005.

Given the strength of Amazon\rquote s brand in 2005, we agree with Mr. Haigh that it is appropriate to select as the base royalty rate the highest of these rates (1.0%), which does not differ greatly from the median (0.925%) or the average (0.90%).

Mr. Reilly acknowledged that \u8220\'3fwaterfall\u8221\'3f structures are atypical in agreements that license marketing intangibles. Of the 167 such agreements that he found in the retail and Internet categories, only eight had downward adjustments keyed to higher sales volumes. Mr. Reilly acknowledged that \u8220\'3fin certain instances trademark license royalty rates increase over time or with increased revenue.\u8221\'3f In fact, Mr. Haigh looked at 700 agreements and found 21 that featured increasing royalty rates.

We find that flat royalty rates are the norm in agreements of this type. Even if a volume adjustment were thought appropriate, the evidence is conflicting as to whether the rate should be adjusted upward or downward. We thus conclude that the arm\rquote s-length royalty AEHT must pay for the marketing intangibles is a flat 1.00%.

The parties disagree as to whether the marketing intangibles had a limited useful life (as petitioner contends) or a perpetual or \u8220\'3findefinite\u8221\'3f useful life (as respondent contends).

Mr. Reilly estimated that the useful life of the marketing intangibles was in the range of 10 to 15 years. Like Dr. Unni and Mr. Lasinski, he began by focusing on the terms of the relationship between Amazon US and AEHT. After May 1, 2006, AEHT was responsible for all advertising, development, and trademark-maintenance expenses relating to the European marketing intangibles. Mr. Reilly opined that this is unusual in trademark license agreements; typically, at

Because the going-forward value of the marketing intangibles would increasingly be attributable to marketing investments by AEHT, an unrelated party in its position would not agree to pay royalties forever. As Mr. Reilly explained: \u8220\'3fA trademark is, at any specific moment, the product of investments of the past. * * * [F]uture investments can replace those made in the past, and therefore the value of a trademark built by investments of the past will diminish.

Petitioners\rquote  experts also noted that the value of Amazon\rquote s trademarks or \u8220\'3fbrand\u8221\'3f was closely linked to the state of its technology. If consumers were dissatisfied with their shopping experience, Amazon\rquote s marketing intangibles would rapidly decline in value. AEHT was responsible, not only for ongoing marketing expenses, but also (under the CSA) for its pro rata share of future IDCs that were essential to sustaining the website technology.

As Dr. Unni put it: \u8220\'3f[T]he incremental profits associated to [the marketing] intangibles are progressively attributable to the future business efforts and technology co-development of Amazon Europe.\u8221\'3f He determined that any profits attributable to such intangibles after a period of 15 to 20 years would reflect the quality of AEHT\rquote s ongoing business execution and the effectiveness of supporting technology and subsequently developed intangibles for which AEHT had paid. Mr. Lasinski similarly opined that, if a licensee anticipates incurring substantial future expenses to sustain the value of the licensed marks, it will negotiate for limited-duration payment structures, lower royalty rates, or other concessionary provisions.

Peter Golder, another of petitioner\rquote s experts, used empirical data for technology-driven companies to estimate a useful life for Amazon\rquote s marketing intangibles. As he explained: \u8220\'3fIt is important to remember that expectations about Amazon\rquote s brand are being made as of January 1, 2005, and therefore must not incorporate today\rquote s hindsight.\u8221\'3f He noted that the dot.com crash had occurred just four years previously; that thousands of Internet companies had failed; that Internet retailing (especially in Europe) was still in its infancy; that Amazon\rquote s ability to extend its reach into new product categories was uncertain; and that 75% of independent financial analysts in 2005 had a sell or hold rating on Amazon\rquote s stock.

For his second empirical analysis, which we found most persuasive, Dr. Golder estimated the longevity of leaders and significant competitors in seven eCommerce markets: online brokerages, Internet search engines, online social networks, travel websites, web browsers, smartphones, and video game consoles. He determined that many well-known brands had failed, including more than half of the market pioneers, which had an average time to failure of seven years. His analysis generated estimated useful lives ranging from 10.9

He noted that, under applicable accounting standards, \u8220\'3fthe facts indicate whether the asset has a finite life or not.\u8221\'3f He then made the following assumption:

It is my assumption that the brand has an indefinite * * * [useful life]. This is based on the assumption that there is no foreseeable limit to the period over which the brand is expected to generate net cash inflows for its businesses. This also assumes that trademark registration renewals are filed at the appropriate time and sufficient investment is made in terms of marketing and communication to maintain the value inherent in the brand.

Other than Mr. Haigh, respondent relied on two experts in an effort to demonstrate the longevity of Amazon\rquote s \u8220\'3fbrand\u8221\'3f as of January 1, 2005. Dr. Conley, relying on a theory of \u8220\'3fvalue transference,\u8221\'3f opined that properly managed technology assets enhance the value and extend the life of a company\rquote s brand. He sought to illustrate \u8220\'3fvalue transference\u8221\'3f with examples involving an artificial sweetener and generic pharmaceuticals. But Dr. Dolan showed that these examples proved the opposite: Once the patent expired, the products lost significant value and market share. Dr. Conley admitted that his \u8220\'3fvalue transference\u8221\'3f theory has never been adopted within the valuation community, is not incorporated in any accounting standards, and has not been adopted by any court. We did not find it persuasive.

 Having considered the testimony of these eight experts in light of our findings of fact, we conclude that the marketing intangibles did not have a perpetual useful life, and we reject respondent\rquote s contention that they did. Our conclusion is based on numerous factors as to which petitioner\rquote s experts testified, including the fact that the Internet retail industry was young, the fact that Amazon had operated in Europe for only six years, and the fact that Amazon\rquote s success depended heavily on short-lived technology assets. But our conclusion rests chiefly on the facts that AEHT assumed sole responsibility to maintain and develop the marketing intangibles in Europe and paid, through cost sharing, for the technological improvements essential to maintaining the value of those marketing intangibles.

Petitioner\rquote s experts presented us with useful life estimates for the marketing intangibles that ranged between 8 and 20 years. Mr. Reilly and Dr. Dolan embraced a 10\u8211\'3f15 year range. Dr. Unni embraced a 15\u8211\'3f20 year range. Dr. Golder opined that the useful life could be as short as 8 years but (with certain assumptions and adjustments) could be as long as 20 years.

We conclude that a useful life at the top of these ranges is appropriate. We agree with Dr. Wilcox that Amazon at year-end 2004 had a very strong brand in Europe and that the strength of its brand supports a relatively long useful life. By 2000 Amazon\rquote s primary domains in the UK, Germany, and France represented the three most popular online retail domains in Europe. In all three countries Amazon had the highest brand awareness of any online retailer. When asked about places to shop on the Internet in 2005, European customers told pollsters that Amazon was the brand that first came to mind. Considering all the evidence, we find that the marketing intangibles had a useful life of 20 years, which is the top end of Dr. Unni\rquote s and Dr. Golder\rquote s ranges and not too far from the high end of Mr. Reilly\rquote s range.

He selected 4% as AEHT\rquote s stable growth rate, using long-term growth and inflation projections for the eurozone. Under this approach, which we accept here, AEHT\rquote s rate of revenue growth declined to its 4% stable rate starting in 2017.

Mr. Reilly excluded these revenues because these services were projected to operate at a significant loss; in his opinion, an arm\rquote s-length licensee would not pay royalties on negative revenue streams.

We conclude that Mr. Reilly correctly excluded these revenues. Before Project Goldcrest various intercompany agreements designated the European Subsidiaries \u8220\'3fcommissionaires\u8221\'3f for Amazon US, entitling them to commissions based on their net sales. The term \u8220\'3fnet sales\u8221\'3f was defined to exclude giftwrap, shipping, and miscellaneous services revenue. Because Amazon US refused to pay commissions on these types of revenue, we conclude that AEHT, operating at arm\rquote s length, would likewise refuse to pay royalties thereon.

 pp. 124\u8211\'3f126. The rest of the difference reflects the fact that Mr. Haigh does not compute the beta for Amazon itself; instead he uses an average of betas derived from companies he regards as comparable, such as eBay, Yahoo!, Netflix, Overstock.com, Barnes & Noble, and 1\u8211\'3f800\u8211\'3fFlowers.

We reject this approach. As Dr. Unni explains, a valuation expert typically looks to comparable companies to derive a beta when the subject company\rquote s stock is thinly traded or not publicly traded at all. That is not the situation here: Amazon was a very actively traded stock, with an average daily NASDAQ trading volume of 8.51 million shares during 2004. Because the Bloomberg market data were more than sufficient to compute Amazon\rquote s beta directly, as every other expert in this case did, there was no need to consult data concerning other companies.

Petitioner tasked one of its experts, Mr. Franklyn, with responsibility for examining the European registration files, ascertaining which domain names and marks were legally owned by the European Subsidiaries, and determining what percentage of the overall value should be allocated to those assets. This task was complicated by the fact that certain marks (as explained more fully below) had been registered in Europe both by Amazon US and by Amazon Germany.

 Equally clearly, the European Subsidiaries used these domain names and marks in the active conduct of their business. Before January 2005 the European Subsidiaries were service providers for Amazon US. They had numerous employees of their own who were responsible for vendor and customer relationships. Because of differing cultural preferences, retail traditions, and national regulations, the details of these operations often varied from country to country. Local teams were thus integral to Amazon\rquote s success in Europe.

The ultimate value of the European Portfolio hinged on the European Subsidiaries\rquote  ability to fulfill Amazon\rquote s promise of fast and accurate delivery. Their success in doing so contributed meaningfully to the value of these domain names and marks.

 On these facts, we cannot find that the European Subsidiaries were mere \u8220\'3fagents\u8221\'3f of Amazon US for the purpose of holding title to the European Portfolio. As the ultimate parent, Amazon US had the ability to decide how ownership of the marketing intangibles would be dispersed within the corporate family.

A Deloitte report entitled \u8220\'3fProject Goldcrest: Transfer of Miscellaneous EU Subsidiary IP\u8221\'3f noted that, under the Four\u8211\'3fParty Agreement, the European Subsidiaries assigned their interests in the European Portfolio to AEHT for about $2 million.

To tier 1 he assigned Amazon\rquote s three most important marks, \u8220\'3fAmazon,\u8221\'3f \u8220\'3fAmazon.com,\u8221\'3f and \u8220\'3fAmazon and Design.\u8221\'3f To tier 2 he assigned the five marks covering the most significant European domain names.

Because the tier 1 marks were weighted so heavily (at 75%) and the tier 3 marks so lightly (at 6.2%), the European Portfolio ended up with 52% and 42% of the aggregate trademark value under Mr. Franklyn\rquote s two approaches. Those percentages rose to 54% and 47% of the total intangible value after he accounted for domain names.

We conclude that respondent has the stronger side of this argument. Mr. Franklyn provided no theoretical or technical support for his \u8220\'3fcoexistence\u8221\'3f model as a valuation technique. In every case of overlapping trademarks, that model allocated value 50\u8211\'3f50 between the European and the US Portfolios, regardless of registration priority, Nice classifications claimed, and the relative strength of the registrants\rquote  competing claims. We find this approach to be arbitrary and unreliable.

While Mr. Franklyn\rquote s \u8220\'3fgoods and services\u8221\'3f model may have a firmer conceptual footing, we agree with respondent\rquote s critique of his implementation of this approach. First, it seems clear to us that Mr. Franklyn overweighted tier 1 and underweighted tier 3. He testified that he used the \u8220\'3frule of the mean\u8221\'3f to allocate 75% of the total value to tier 1 and a mere 6.2% to tier 3. Respondent urges, and we agree, that this was little more than a guess and was not based on any recognized principles governing valuation of intellectual property.

Mr. Franklyn placed in tier 3 a total of 31 trademarks, the vast majority of which were owned by Amazon US. Nine of these marks were rated as \u8220\'3fsignificant\u8221\'3f by Deloitte. Mr. Haigh reasonably concluded that several other tier 3 marks, including \u8220\'3fAmazon.com & Design\u8221\'3f and the \u8220\'3fAmazon Smile\u8221\'3f logo, were likewise very important to Amazon\rquote s business. It seems clear to us that the tier 3 trademarks accounted for substantially more than 6.2% of the overall value.

 because its application was filed in 1996, whereas Amazon Germany\rquote s was not filed until 2000. Mr. Franklyn nevertheless allocated 85% of this trademark\rquote s value to the European Portfolio; he did so because Amazon Germany\rquote s application included Nice class 35, which was not among the three Nice classes that Amazon US had claimed four years previously.

The customer information that Amazon US made available to AEHT consisted of data about European retail customers who had transacted with the European Subsidiaries before May 1, 2006. These data included names, email addresses, phone numbers, credit card information, and purchasing history. By making this information available to AEHT, Amazon US in effect was referring its existing European customers to AEHT and furnishing it with certain information about them.

 rates generally ranged from 4% to 8% in the Associates program and from 4% to 6% in the Syndicated Stores program.

Dr. Higinbotham determined that people arriving at Amazon through a mirror site typically converted to direct Amazon customers within 90 days. He accordingly valued the customer information as the sum of: (1) a \u163\'3f7 bounty for each European customer that Amazon U.S. transferred to AEHT on May 1, 2006, and (2) a 6% commission computed on AEHT\rquote s total sales during the 90 days immediately following the May 1, 2006, business transfer. He thus derived a value of $214.5 million for the customer information.

 in place for the European Subsidiaries during 2004\u8211\'3f2006. (By using actual rates he accounted for cases where fee caps or similar provisions caused variance from the nominal rate.)

Dr. Wills\rquote  next step was to estimate the revenue stream to which this 5.9% referral fee should apply. In approaching this question, he noted that Amazon would pay a commission to an Associate only if the customer arrived directly from the Associate\rquote s site and made a purchase within 24 hours. Amazon was willing to pay a large commission on this initial purchase because it was confident that the purchaser would soon become a direct Amazon customer, on whose future purchases no commissions would be due. Dr. Wills accordingly concluded that AEHT, operating at arm\rquote s length, would not pay referral fees to Amazon US on revenues derived from the initially referred European customers once those individuals had \u8220\'3fconverted\u8221\'3f to AEHT customers and purchased items by coming directly to AEHT\rquote s sites. Dr. Higinbotham agreed with this proposition.

To ascertain the \u8220\'3fconversion\u8221\'3f rate, Dr. Wills relied on analyses performed by Dr. Moe and Mr. Wentland. Using Associates program data from January 2004 through April 2006, Dr. Moe analyzed subsequent spending by European customers who had originally arrived at an Amazon website via referral. To the extent these customers made future purchases by coming to an Amazon site directly, rather than by referral from a partner\rquote s site, she deemed them to have \u8220\'3fconverted.\u8221\'3f

Her analysis shows a very rapid rate of conversion, with 83.5% of referred customers becoming direct Amazon customers within one year.

Dr. Wills concluded that the future revenue stream on which AEHT would have to pay referral fees equaled the sum of: (1) the initial purchases that the referred European customers made from AEHT and (2) subsequent purchases those individuals would make from AEHT upon referral from a mirror site rather than as \u8220\'3fconverted\u8221\'3f AEHT customers. Dr. Moe\rquote s analysis provided an estimate of the median and average amounts that customers would spend, per visit to AEHT\rquote s sites, during the 10\u8211\'3fyear period following the business transfer. Dr. Wills used the median amounts in his analysis and concluded that AEHT, operating at arm\rquote s length, would agree to pay referral fees only for six years.

Respondent challenges Dr. Wills\rquote  $51.9 million valuation on several grounds, the first of which concerns the cutoff date for paying referral fees. Dr. Wills acknowledged that there was a long \u8220\'3ftail\u8221\'3f of unconverted customers in the Associates program; indeed, 10% of customers initially referred from a partner\rquote s site continued to return to Amazon by referral eight years later. Dr. Wills admitted that there was no obvious \u8220\'3fbright line\u8221\'3f dictating when referral fees should stop. Although he had data from the Associates program going out 10 years, he opined that a term of 6 years would be generous.

We agree with respondent that Dr. Wills\rquote  selection of a truncated six-year period was arbitrary. Although he assumed that AEHT would refuse to pay for the long \u8220\'3ftail\u8221\'3f of customer referrals, Amazon did just that in its Associates program. There is no evidence that Amazon placed any cap on the length of time it was willing to pay commissions on purchases by customers who came to its websites by referral,

 even if those customers had previously purchased from Amazon directly. Since Dr. Wills had reliable data for 10 years, we conclude that the buy-in payment should reflect referral fees for that entire period. Dr. Wills performed this calculation and determined that the buy-in payment (holding all other aspects of his computation constant) would rise to $66.3 million if a 10\u8211\'3fyear cutoff were used.

Second, respondent contends that Dr. Wills understated the revenue stream for computing referral fees by using the median rather the average amounts that customers were expected to spend per visit. Dr. Moe\rquote s analysis showed that a small subset of customers was responsible for a disproportionate dollar amount of sales. Thus the average spending per customer was significantly higher than the median spending per customer.

Dr. Wills testified that using the median was appropriate because using the average would likely overestimate future customer spending. Extrapolating customer spending out a decade resulted in a subset of customers with very high spending. Dr. Wills reasoned that customers would not increase their spending year after year indefinitely, and he used Dr. Moe\rquote s median figures to reduce the impact of outliers caused by the extrapolation.

Respondent\rquote s expert Dr. Wilcox opined that use of average spending was more appropriate. He noted that retailers often expect to earn a significant portion of their profits from a small subset of their customers. A desire to reduce the impact of high-spending customers, he opined, was not a sufficient justification for rejecting the use of average data.

We agree with Dr. Wilcox. High-spending customers are the customers a retailer most desires to have. We see no reason why AEHT, operating at arm\rquote s length, would insist on paying referral fees calculated to exclude these customers. Petitioner did not show that high-spending customers tend to \u8220\'3fconvert\u8221\'3f to direct Amazon customers at a different rate from low-spending customers.

In his rebuttal report Dr. Wilcox revised Dr. Wills\rquote  calculations by using average spending levels and a 10\u8211\'3fyear cutoff for payment of referral fees. He thus derived a value of $129 million for the customer information. We find this to be the arm\rquote s-length buy-in payment for this group of intangibles.

Respondent contends that Dr. Wills\rquote  approach, even if modified as we have done above, does not capture the full value of Amazon\rquote s customer information. Forrest Oswald, one of respondent\rquote s experts, opined that Dr. Wills erred by valuing solely the customer referral, rather than the complete universe of customer data (including purchase history, addresses, and credit card information) that Amazon US made available to AEHT. Mr. Oswald opined that the latter information would enable AEHT to provide a more streamlined and personalized user experience, even after the referred customers had become regular AEHT customers.

While Mr. Oswald is correct that Amazon\rquote s customer information had uses apart from customer referral, the trial established that this value had a very short life. Amazon US used customer information to power its \u8220\'3fSimilarities\u8221\'3f and \u8220\'3fRecommendations\u8221\'3f software, as well as to improve the customer experience through one-click shopping and email marketing. But Amazon itself regarded this historical data as having limited utility; stored addresses and credit card information rapidly become outdated, and customers\rquote  buying habits change significantly over time. For its Similarities software, Amazon uses only relatively recent data because it regards older data as having little or no value. Indeed, older data may have negative value because they yield irrelevant or inappropriate recommendations.

 opinion of Amazon; arguably, this \u8220\'3fbrand loyalty\u8221\'3f would predispose them to keep patronizing AEHT.

Although he looked to the Associates and Syndicated Stores agreements to derive an arm\rquote s-length commission rate, he used Amazon\rquote s experience to estimate customers\rquote  future spending. Those spending levels presumably reflect the value of Amazon\rquote s brand.

 p. 12. Dr. Wills\rquote  methodology, in which Dr. Higinbotham ultimately concurred, reasonably captures the arm\rquote s-length value of the customer referrals that Amazon US made to AEHT. We conclude that any value associated with the customer information in excess of the value of customer referral was short-lived and immaterial or was adequately accounted for in Dr. Wills\rquote  valuation of the marketing intangibles and website technology, on which the strength of Amazon\rquote s brand was based. We accordingly find that Dr. Wills\rquote  approach, as modified in the two respects discussed above, yields an appropriate arm\rquote s-length buy-in payment of $129 million for the customer information.

Dr. Higinbotham, one of respondent\rquote s experts, agreed that substantial non\u8211\'3fIDCs were accumulated in the T&C cost centers, and he used a modified version of petitioner\rquote s cost-allocation method when determining his buy-in payment for the website technology.

To remedy this flaw, Dr. Higinbotham significantly reduced or eliminated the role of the T\u8211\'3fratio. For cost centers in the 7000 series, he set the T\u8211\'3fratio at 100%, effectively eliminating it. He did the same for cost centers in the 5000 series with at least an 80% response rate to the QRE survey and for certain other 5000\u8211\'3fseries cost centers with \u8220\'3fa logic behind doing it.\u8221\'3f For the remaining 5000\u8211\'3fseries cost centers, he assigned the same T\u8211\'3fratio that Amazon had assigned, but made modifications to better capture the cost of interns as if they were T\u8211\'3fcoded employees. Dr. Higinbotham described these adjustments as his \u8220\'3fmost important\u8221\'3f change to petitioner\rquote s cost-allocation formula. Petitioner has accepted all of these adjustments, and we find them to be appropriate.

Dr. Higinbotham\rquote s second adjustment to petitioner\rquote s formula involved the treatment of certain indirect costs. The QRE survey data compiled by PwC captured time devoted to \u8220\'3fdirect supervision and support\u8221\'3f of qualifying research activity. However, petitioner\rquote s formula did not capture the costs of \u8220\'3findirect supervision\u8221\'3f (e.g., time spent by a higher level supervisor) or \u8220\'3findirect support\u8221\'3f (e.g., time spent by a supervisor\rquote s executive assistant). Because the CSA defined IDCs to include \u8220\'3fall direct and indirect costs\u8221\'3f of intangible development, Dr. Higinbotham concluded that an additional modification to petitioner\rquote s cost-allocation formula was necessary.

These two modifications by Dr. Higinbotham were significant, increasing petitioner\rquote s IDCs by more than $50 million for each year at issue. At trial Dr. Higinbotham agreed with Dr. Weil that, whereas salary weighting was appropriately applied to employee costs, headcount weighting was more appropriately applied to the remaining costs. This further adjustment reduced Dr. Higinbotham\rquote s results by $3 million and $5 million for 2005 and 2006, respectively. We conclude that Dr. Higinbotham\rquote s results, as thus adjusted, yield a formula that allocates costs \u8220\'3fbetween the intangible development area and the other areas or business activities on a reasonable basis.\u8221\'3f

We do not accept three further modifications to petitioner\rquote s allocation formula that respondent has urged at various times. First, in the notice of deficiency respondent contended that petitioner erred in eliminating from the T&C cost centers all costs captured in 26 general ledger accounts that petitioner deemed unrelated to intangible development.

Examples of the eliminated accounts include 64168 (Pallet Expense), 64712 (Warehouse Supplies), 64715 (Safety Supplies), 64331 (Depreciation: Heavy Equipment), and 64332 (Depreciation: Vehicles). Drs. Weil and Higinbotham agreed that it was reasonable to exclude from IDCs the costs captured in these accounts solely on the basis of the account description, without investigating the subsidiary costs in detail. Respondent in his post-trial briefs largely abandoned any challenge to this conclusion, which we believe to be correct.

The Cost Sharing Arrangement actually involved two successive agreements. In December 2004 Amazon US and AEHT entered into an \u8220\'3fAgreement to Share Costs and Risks of Intangible Development\u8221\'3f with a stated effective date of June 7, 2004. On January 11, 2005, Amazon US and AEHT entered into an \u8220\'3fAmended and Restated Agreement to Share Costs and Risks of Intangible Development\u8221\'3f with a stated effective date of January 1, 2005. We will generally use the term \u8220\'3fCost Sharing Arrangement\u8221\'3f or \u8220\'3fCSA\u8221\'3f to refer to the latter.

It provided for a 5% referral fee, which could increase to 6% if certain aggregate sales thresholds were met. This agreement had an unusual feature whereby Amazon would also pay Waterstone\rquote s a one-time bounty of \u163\'3f7 for new purchases by certain customers.

 pp. 117\u8211\'3f120, we do not conclude that the website technology transferred in January 2005 had become wholly worthless at year-end 2011. It continued to have some residual value; it could be used for research and as a springboard for developing replacement technology. We conclude that a \u8220\'3ftail\u8221\'3f of 3\u8211\'3f1/2 years is appropriate to capture this residual value. But this residual value, when added to the initial seven-year value, does not come close to Dr. Frisch\rquote s $3.468 billion figure.

Petitioner urges that Dr. Frisch made other errors that affect the reliability of his conclusions. For example, when subtracting AEHT\rquote s projected capital expenditures from its future cash flows, he neglected to exclude startup expenses for the Luxembourg headquarters and the Irish data center. According to petitioner, correction of this oversight would reduce Dr. Frisch\rquote s valuation by $400 million. Separately, when subtracting AEHT\rquote s projected cost sharing payments from its future cash flows, Dr. Frisch assumed that Amazon\rquote s IDCs would grow at an annual rate of only 5% after 2005. If Dr. Frisch had used the IDCs as calculated by Dr. Higinbotham, petitioner contends that the valuation would be reduced to $2.946 billion. Although these (and other) challenges to Dr. Frisch\rquote s report have force, we need not consider them in detail. Respondent\rquote s \u8220\'3fbusiness enterprise\u8221\'3f approach to determining an arm\rquote s-length buy-in payment for pre-existing intangibles is flawed in its central premise because it is inconsistent with the pre\u8211\'3f2009 cost sharing regulations. That being so, modifying the details of Dr. Frisch\rquote s implementation of that approach would not carry the day.

Dr. MacCormack employed a variety of \u8220\'3frobustness\u8221\'3f checks to confirm his conclusion, including an analysis of actual changes to Amazon\rquote s source code between 2000 and 2005. This ex ante analysis, like his ex post analysis, focused both on component changes and architectural changes. Dr. MacCormack\rquote s ex ante analysis yielded decay curves resembling those generated by his ex post data.

Dr. MacCormack reasonably decided, for two reasons, not to base his conclusions solely on ex ante data. First, during 2002\u8211\'3f2005 Amazon was migrating from one code repository to another; because of the risk of overlapping or missing files during this period, Dr. MacCormack believed that ex post data were more reliable because that migration had been completed. Second, because Amazon\rquote s software was undergoing \u8220\'3fsignificant architectural change\u8221\'3f during 2002\u8211\'3f2005, owing to the shift from Obidos to Gurupa, Dr. MacCormack found that \u8220\'3fthere was no guarantee that the pace and nature of Amazon\rquote s software evolution observed in years prior to 2005 could be used to project into the future.\u8221\'3f

Dr. Wills made two modifications to the decay curve shown in the text. He first adjusted the curve to reflect a \u8220\'3fgestation lag\u8221\'3f of six months to account for new technology that may have been partially developed during a prior period. Although no other technology expert included a \u8220\'3fgestation lag,\u8221\'3f he believed that a six-month lag was reasonable on the basis of his experience. In the absence of technical support for a six-month \u8220\'3fgestation lag\u8221\'3f and any consensus that it is necessary, we will not adopt this modification. Second, Dr. Wills extended the initial period on his chart to end on April 30, 2006, rather than December 31, 2005, to reflect the fact that the former was the \u8220\'3fbusiness transfer date.\u8221\'3f This had the effect of reducing the decay percentage for the initial period from 100% to 90.4%. Because no other expert made this adjustment, and because we find no justification or need for it, we will not adopt this modification either.

Respondent\rquote s expert James Conley argues that petitioner\rquote s valuation of the website technology does not capture the full value of Amazon\rquote s patents. The trial established that the value of Amazon\rquote s patents was fairly inconsequential. In any event, AEHT would be required to compensate Amazon US only for European patents; the vast bulk of Amazon\rquote s patents were issued in the United States and would have little or no value in Europe. Scott Hayden credibly testified that it was much more difficult for Amazon to obtain patents for its inventions in Europe. Given these facts, we find that the European patent portfolio had a relatively low value and that the useful life of the technology plus the \u8220\'3ftail\u8221\'3f period adequately captures the value of this portfolio.

CAPM is a standard and widely used method to determine a company\rquote s cost of equity capital. Under the CAPM the expected rate of return for a company\rquote s equity is generally the risk-free rate of return plus the product of beta and an equity risk premium.

Respondent notes that Amazon\rquote s treasury department, for internal discussion purposes, used a discount rate of 13% when evaluating prospective investments. But Dr. Frisch characterized this internal rate as an inaccurate measure of the riskiness of AEHT\rquote s business. In that respect his views align with those of Mr. Szkutak, Amazon\rquote s chief financial officer. He testified that the treasury department rate was a mere benchmark that was increased, to rates above 18%, for speculative investments related to future performance. We decline to adopt as the appropriate discount rate the benchmark rate that Amazon used internally.

Narrowing his search to the retail and Internet industries yielded 167 agreements, all of which he reviewed to find CUTs. He conducted similar searches using two other search engines (Royalty Source and Royalty Range) but did not identify any additional CUTs.

When valuing the website technology, we applied a 25\u8211\'3fbasis-point downward adjustment to the royalty rate because Amazon\rquote s M.com agreements, used as comparables there, provided evidence justifying a modest volume discount. Here we are considering external rather than internal CUTs, and the external CUTs supply no convincing evidence to support reducing the royalty rate at higher sales volumes.

To support this proposition Professor Dolan cited academic literature and Millward Brown\rquote s \u8220\'3fbrand contribution\u8221\'3f measure of Amazon. Millward Brown uses a 1 to 5 scale to measure the importance that brand (as compared with price and product features) plays in a company\rquote s success. Companies with an index of 5 (including such luxury brands as Herm\u232\'3fs, Gucci, Rolex, and Porsche) derive the greatest proportion of their value from the brand itself. Companies with an index of 1 (including Domino\rquote s Pizza and 76 Motor Fuels) derive the least proportion of their value from the brand itself. Millward Brown gave Amazon a rating of 2 on this scale, which is consistent with a relatively low brand impact assessment.

Mr. Reilly believed that a \u8220\'3framp down\u8221\'3f could be justified toward the end of the marketing intangibles\rquote  useful life, but he did not include a decay curve in his valuation. As he explained, this was a conservative assumption that arguably introduced \u8220\'3fan upward bias in his final buy-in price conclusion.\u8221\'3f Since petitioner does not urge application of a decay curve here, we have no occasion to decide whether it would be appropriate.

Because Mr. Haigh did not, before his rebuttal report, question the propriety of using the 50% declining balance method, the testimony and other evidence on this point were limited. During his oral testimony Mr. Reilly cited a publication by McKinsey & Co., \u8220\'3fValuation: Measuring and Managing the Value of Companies,\u8221\'3f for the proposition that the 50% declining balance method is a standard valuation technique for moving from revenue projections to long-term growth rates. On the basis of the limited testimony provided to us, we have no reason to question the appropriateness of employing that method here.

Under the Protocol Relating to the Madrid Agreement Concerning the International Registration of Marks (Madrid Protocol), a trademark owner can file a single trademark-registration application with a single office, in one language, in one currency, with one set of fees. After filing this original application, the owner can submit an \u8220\'3finternational application\u8221\'3f listing additional countries in which a trademark registration will be sought. The initial country\rquote s trademark office will confirm that the international application complies with local requirements, then forward it to the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO). The WIPO submits the international application to the individual trademark offices of the countries designated in the international application. The designated countries will then examine the international application in accordance with their own procedures for national trademarks.

The Nice Classification is an international system recognized by national trademark offices as a means of describing and classifying goods and services in trademark applications. For example, tea may be appropriate for Nice class 5 as medicinal tea and for Nice class 30 as non-medicinal tea. By registering a mark for tea in class 30, an applicant may forfeit any protection that might be claimed under class 5. In Europe, Nice classes have an important practical impact on the scope of protection that a trademark affords. Amazon US and Amazon Germany filed, at various times, overlapping and competing registrations of the same trademarks under different Nice classes.

In his \u8220\'3fcoexistence\u8221\'3f model, Mr. Franklyn rationalized allocating to the European Portfolio half the value of numerous trademarks, including the \u8220\'3fAmazon\u8221\'3f mark, under principles of \u8220\'3facquiescence.\u8221\'3f Under that doctrine, a trademark holder (such as Amazon US) can be divested of its trademark protection if it does not challenge an overlapping mark (such as that registered by Amazon Germany) within five years. Mr. Franklyn offered no authority to support the proposition that \u8220\'3facquiescence\u8221\'3f would apply with full force inside a corporate group or that a parent corporation could be divested of trademark protection by an action taken by its subsidiary. In any event, even if \u8220\'3facquiescence\u8221\'3f applied to the same corporate group, Amazon Germany did not register its \u8220\'3fAmazon\u8221\'3f mark until mid\u8211\'3f2000, and the valuation here is being performed as of January 1, 2005, less than five years later. On January 1, 2005, Amazon US (or a hypothetical third party that had acquired the trademark from Amazon US) could still have challenged Amazon Germany\rquote s mark and potentially excluded Amazon Germany from using it.

We have neither the data nor the ability to perform a precise \u8220\'3fcorrection\u8221\'3f of Mr. Franklyn\rquote s \u8220\'3fgoods and services\u8221\'3f model to eliminate the errors discussed in the text and other errors of which respondent complains. However, if the bulk of the tier 1 trademark value were allocated to the US Portfolio as we think necessary, and if the tier 3 trademarks were given an appropriate heavier weighting (say 20% instead of 6.2%), we suspect that reasonable permutations of Mr. Franklyn\rquote s model would gravitate toward Mr. Haigh\rquote s 25% conclusion.

A simplified example may illustrate this difference. Assume that 1,000 customers are referred to Amazon\rquote s website from mirror sites, with 900 making purchases of $20 and 100 making purchases of $100. The median spending per customer would be $20, but the average spending would be $28.

Respondent\rquote s position would apparently require evaluation of 500 general-ledger accounts and 100 general-ledger account rollups for each of the T&C cost centers. Because petitioner had between 162 and 221 T&C cost centers during 2005 and 2006, this would necessitate several hundred thousand discrete evaluations. This would plainly be overkill; the regulations require only that the allocation be made \u8220\'3fon a reasonable basis.\u8221\'3f

Respondent argues that Dr. Higinbotham, when preparing his expert reports, did not have enough evidence to decide upon an accurate allocation method. But the parties conducted very extensive discovery in this case; if Dr. Higinbotham believed he lacked certain necessary information, respondent was free to request it. In any event, respondent stands behind Dr. Higinbotham\rquote s ultimate conclusion, which necessarily includes his underlying calculations.

A corollary to this flaw was the exclusion of time spent by paid interns. They completed QRE surveys and recorded time to T&C cost centers, but they did not have a T\u8211\'3fcoded job classification. Use of the T\u8211\'3fratio effectively eliminated their time from the cost pool even if they did 100% intangible development.

. While urging that petitioner has not satisfied the latter requirement, respondent has not advanced a coherent theory as to how a taxpayer would go about estimating the \u8220\'3ftotal benefits\u8221\'3f attributable to costs accumulated within each of several thousand cost centers. We conclude that a properly constructed allocation formula, such as that approved in the text, will accomplish the desired result in petitioner\rquote s case.
