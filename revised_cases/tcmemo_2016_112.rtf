IRS Commissioner\rquote s comparable profits method (CPM) analysis, prior to making its determination under statute regarding allocation of income and deductions among corporate taxpayer and its subsidiaries and affiliates, was misleading in its calculation of return on operating assets (ROA) as profit level indicator, where analysis ignored valuable intangible assets that were obtained through medical devices and leads licenses merely because these assets were not recorded on taxpayer\rquote s balance sheet.

In IRS Commissioner\rquote s comparable profits method (CPM) analysis, prior to making its determination under statute regarding allocation of income and deductions among corporate taxpayer and its subsidiaries and affiliates, aggregating transactions did not result in reasonable determination of true taxable income, where aggregations resulted in assigning value to Puerto Rican subsidiary\rquote s functions and allocating system profits to subsidiary, resulting in allocation of unreasonably small percentage of profits to subsidiary.

Allocations of income and deductions among corporate taxpayer and its subsidiaries and affiliates, as made in IRS Commissioner\rquote s comparable profits method (CPM) analysis, were arbitrary, capricious, or unreasonable, and thus analysis was not best method for determining arm\rquote s-length result, where analysis was dismissive of Puerto Rican subsidiary\rquote s important role in quality, including not only its manufacture of implantable medical devices, but also its expertise in design and quality improvements, which resulted in unreasonably low adjusted royalty rate that attributed only 6-8% of profits to subsidiary.

 Since the early 1960s petitioner has been a leading medical technology company with operations and sales worldwide. By 2005 petitioner operated in more than 120 countries and had approximately 33,000 employees worldwide. During 2005 and 2006 petitioner operated through multiple business units; this case, however, involves only the Cardiac Rhythm Disease Management (CRDM) and Neurological (Neuro) business units. During the years at issue CRDM had more employees and substantially more revenue than Neuro. Both business units had devices and leads that are at issue in this case. The device operations across both business units were larger and earned more revenues than the leads operations. Medtronic maintained its operations in Puerto Rico through MPROC.

 FDA requires all manufacturers of medical devices distributed in the United States to register their facilities, list their medical devices, and follow certain requirements. The FDA classifies medical devices according to the risks that they pose to consumers. The Medical Device Amendments of 1976 to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act classified medical devices that were on the market at the time into one of three classes: class I, class II, and class III. Medical Device Amendments of 1976,

 Stat. at 540-541. Class I medical devices are subject to the fewest regulatory control, and class III medical devices are subject to the most stringent controls. Class III medical devices must comply with certain controls and go through a premarket approval (PMA) process. The PMA process is lengthy and can often take 5 to 10 years. Class III medical devices are higher risk and more novel than are those of classes I and II.

Class III medical devices must typically be approved by FDA before they are marketed through the PMA process. The PMA process is rigorous, costly, and time consuming. It requires a demonstration that the new medical device is safe and effective. That demonstration is performed by collecting data, including human clinical data, for the medical device.

 Product quality, however, was the driving factor for success in the industry. Without it, neither the innovativeness of a company\rquote s products nor the effectiveness of a company\rquote s service professionals would ultimately matter. There are several examples in the industry, discussed in greater detail below, of companies that have been adversely affected, acquired by competitors, or driven out of business because of actual or perceived product quality problems. Thus, there was a significant focus on quality, which included quality product designs and quality manufacture of components and finished products.

A key to a company\rquote s reputation and its relationship with physicians is how the company handles product flaws once they are known. Physicians expect that companies will notify them about problems along with the probability of occurrence so that they can decide how to best treat their patients. A company\rquote s failure to timely communicate to its customers can seriously harm its reputation.

The companies that competed successfully in the implantable medical device industry met the needs of their customers and differentiated themselves from their competitors by continuing to deepen the extent to which they met those needs. These companies progressively grew their customer base through deepening customer satisfaction and expanding their market share through product diversification. Product quality, however, remained the foundation that determined the extent to which companies met each of these goals.

The threat of class action lawsuits or multidistrict proceedings are frequent consequences of product recalls in the medical device industry. The type of insurance coverage that Medtronic needed to insure itself fully against its product liability risk, namely \u8220\'3fcatastrophic insurance\u8221\'3f on the order of billions of dollars, was not available in the marketplace during the years at issue. Since 2002 Medtronic has been unable to obtain product liability insurance to insure against losses at commercially acceptable premium amounts. Thus, Medtronic self-insured against product liability risk, effective May 1, 2002, as well as during 2005 and 2006. The decision to self-insure increased the level of scrutiny placed on quality. Once Medtronic made the decision to self-insure against product liability risk and no longer had any other kind of insurance to pay for losses associated with product quality, it was even more important that the finished product function properly.

One aspect of Medtronic\rquote s business and legal groups\rquote  responsibilities involved identifying and resolving customer complaints regarding product problems as early as possible. Because Medtronic was self-insured during 2005 and 2006, its claim management process was intended to minimize the risk of product liability litigation.

Quality was always the first topic discussed at Medtronic\rquote s executive committee meetings and quarterly reviews. Quality was of the utmost importance in the devices and leads industry because the completed product would be implanted in a human body. The failure of an implanted device or lead can result in severe problems for the patient, and unfortunately even death.

Medtronic US was the first in the industry to issue \u8220\'3fproduct performance reports\u8221\'3f, which aggregate longevity and reliability data for both devices and leads, as well as information concerning recalls or advisories for the use of physicians. Many physicians scrutinized these product performance reports, which Medtronic US first introduced in 1983 following a significant product recall, to ensure that the products they implanted were reliable and of the highest quality. Physicians would make their purchasing decisions accordingly.

MPROC had a vice president of operations responsible for its management. This individual was in touch with operations in Minnesota, but he ran the MPROC facility. He did not need permission from Medtronic US to make hiring and firing decisions. He made numerous key hires to help grow and unify MPROC. He was able to purchase capital equipment with a price up to $450,000 without approval. In addition, he could approve certain changes in the manufacturing process without approval. If a change was significant, the design team would be notified. Certain design changes would also need approval by the FDA. His role included providing followup to the FDA after a site visit in Puerto Rico. For example, he signed a response and sent it to the FDA after a visit. The response provided detailed information to the FDA about testing issues discovered during the site visit.

During 2005 and 2006 MPROC employed almost 2,300 people across its three sites, with approximately 500 in the device operations and 1,500 in the leads operations. About 70%-75% of those employees worked on the manufacturing lines. Turnover of MPROC\rquote s employees was very low. Temporary employees were hired sometimes to address workflow problems.

 MPROC was responsible for its own talent acquisition and management, compensation and benefits, organizational development, hiring, firing, training, disciplinary proceedings, employee relations, and promotion decisions for virtually all positions, including the device operations and the leads operations managers. MPROC\rquote s human resources function was also responsible for integrating the employees across all three sites. Operators at MPROC had to receive extensive training to become certified on the various manufacturing processes related to the devices and leads that MPROC manufactured. Certification could take up to three months, depending on the complexity of the particular process.

FDA regulations require all class III finished medical devices, including the devices and leads manufactured by MPROC, to receive a PMA before they may be marketed in the United States. To obtain a PMA, Medtronic US is required to submit to the FDA an application for the class III finished medical device that includes: full reports of all clinical studies and investigations of the device\rquote s safety and effectiveness that have been published or are known to Medtronic US; the proposed labeling for the device; a full statement of the device\rquote s components, ingredients, and properties and of the principles of operation; a full description of the methods used in, and facilities and controls used for, the manufacture, processing, and, when relevant, packing and installation of the device; and samples of device components. MPROC provided input for the manufacturing sections of regulatory submissions. MPROC received the manufacturing section of the PMA submission packet that had already been drafted, and then reviewed it for accuracy and provided input. For postmarket submissions, MPROC noted, investigated, and corrected deviations from the manufacturing processes that the FDA had approved.

 MPROC and its manufacturing facilities at Juncos and Villalba, Puerto Rico, were subject to regular inspection by the FDA and international regulatory agencies. All three sites were registered sites with the FDA. MPROC personnel were responsible for managing and supervising each of these regulatory inspections, for producing any documents requested during the regulatory inspections, and for providing any written responses to questions arising from the inspections. At the beginning of an inspection, the FDA issues Form 482, Notice of Inspection, to the most responsible individuals at each manufacturing site to ensure that the agency is getting the best information it can from a regulatory perspective. During each inspection of MPROC, FDA Forms 482 were issued to MPROC personnel.

 To comply with the requirements of 21 C.F.R. sec. 820 of the FDA\rquote s Quality System Regulation, MPROC\rquote s quality systems were both extremely broad in scope and detailed. Its systems covered numerous aspects of product quality, including incoming inspection, sterilization, corrective and preventative action (CAPA), and complaint handling, as well as the environmental, health and safety function, process excellence, the product traceability process, nonconformance evaluations, internal audits, product hold orders, management reviews, and the management of material review requests.

The CAPA program was especially important. Each of MPROC\rquote s sites independently maintained a CAPA board, which managed the CAPAs and decided whether to open or close a case on the basis of a quality complaint. If a CAPA was opened, the goal was to investigate, understand, and resolve the problem. Only the finished goods manufacturers, such as MPROC or Medtronic Europe, would instigate a CAPA. The components manufacturers, such and MMC or MECC, would become involved only if, through the CAPA investigation, MPROC discovered a problem at the components manufacturing level. If the components manufacturers became involved, MPROC would still manage the CAPA and the interaction with the supplier.

By understanding the cause of any reworked, defective, or rejected devices or leads, or any problems that might arise with respect to a manufacturing process, similar or related problems could be avoided in the future. MPROC was responsible for conducting all investigations of CAPA events and complaints for product issues that originate at MPROC.

 computer-based devices that continually monitor the heart, analyze cardiac signals, and apply therapeutic actions based on their programming algorithms. Leads are flexible sets of wire that connect the IPGs to the heart. Leads connect at one end to the heart and at the other end to the IPG. Programmers are external devices that communicate through the skin to the IPG to obtain information from the IPG regarding its activities. Programmers were manufactured by an outside vendor and are not relevant to this case.

During 2005 and 2006 the device operations at MPROC built more than 40 different models of devices and approximately 250,000 to 280,000 devices per year; it was the primary or sole manufacturer of most models of devices sold in the United States. Devices comprised approximately 750 individual components, which were purchased from third parties as well as from MMC and MECC. CRDM had its own quality manuals.

 The device operations made complex pieces of electronic machinery that are extremely difficult to manufacture. The process was labor and capital intensive and time consuming and required numerous quality checks. Manufacturing a device was a multistep process in which a hybrid, a battery, a capacitor, a connector, and other components were constructed within a metal shield. There were approximately 40 total steps in the manufacturing of a device. Depending on the complexity of the particular device, manufacturing could take 7 to 14 days to build a single device.

While the device operations used automated processes to manufacture devices, they relied on employees to verify those automated processes, to perform multiple quality inspections throughout each manufacturing stage, to complete significant portions of the processes manually, and to oversee and troubleshoot all manufacturing processes generally. Highly trained and skilled operators oversaw all manufacturing processes. MPROC had to use extreme care to interconnect the various components of the device, ensure that the device was hermetically sealed, and sterilize the device. With regard to the interconnect welding step of the device manufacturing process, for example, operators had to painstakingly inspect the welding that took place at each and every preceding step of the device manufacturing process for any discoloration or damage.

In the case of CRDM leads, an extraction was the most risky procedure an electrophysiologist could perform on a patient.

 Even after a new product had been approved by the FDA and introduced into the marketplace, MPROC continued to suggest and implement improvements to the manufacturing process and product design in order to improve product quality. MPROC was responsible for determining what manufacturing process improvements were needed to make to the products it manufactured. MPROC was also responsible for determining whether changes that it made to the manufacturing process required reporting to the FDA and other regulatory agencies and, if so, for reporting those changes to Medtronic US for submission to the regulatory agencies. While FDA and other such regulatory approval may be required before MPROC may implement a change, Medtronic US did not need to approve the change and lacked the manufacturing expertise to do so.

Examples of MPROC\rquote s manufacturing process improvement activities during 2005 and 2006 included: implementing a laser ribbon bonder; resolving manufacturing problems that caused damage to a molded component that included a steroid drug on a particular lead; and eliminating wrinkling in leads. For example, MPROC developed the second generation of the laser ribbon bonder, a machine that connects components within devices through the use of laser welding and indium ribbon. MPROC\rquote s engineers also developed a method to translate the manufacturing process from the first generation of the machine, which used older, less accurate technology, to the newly developed machine, eliminating the need for design assurance testing and thereby reducing considerably expenses. While MPROC patented certain process innovations, many of its projects are protected by Medtronic as trade secrets.

Thus, MPROC\rquote s DRM input was critical to ensuring that any new product could be commercially manufactured with maximum reliability and quality. Even if a product could be manufactured during the development phase, there was no guaranty that it could be manufactured reliably at commercial scale in a high-volume manufacturing environment.

 Sales representatives performed CRDM sales through the distribution agreement with Med USA. Sales representatives underwent both initial sales and technical training for about 18 months. Training involved study at home and at Minnesota facilities. CRDM instructors and outside physicians participated in the training at the Minnesota facilities by observing and working in the field with experienced representatives during implants, taking qualifying tests, working with a partner in the field before certification as \u8220\'3fimplant ready\u8221\'3f, and getting continuing education about new features and new products, which required more certifications before getting permission to sell. Sales representatives and clinical specialists reviewed a patient\rquote s problems with a physician in order to support the physician with the choice of a device, then supported the physician during the implant and ensured that the device was working properly by taking electrical measurements, and then provided postoperative followup support. CRDM clinical specialists had similar roles as sales representatives in working directly with physicians but did not have sales responsibility.

 CRDM devices and leads came with extensive manuals, which sales representatives were required to be familiar with in order to answer any physician questions. Sales representatives were expected to know CRDM products, including product data and features. They were familiar with CRDM materials that compared the capabilities of the CRDM devices and were able to explain the differences to physicians. Sales representatives were also expected to know and explain to physicians how the features of CRDM products compared to those of competitors. Sales representatives were not responsible for ensuring that the CRDM products worked before they were sterilized and put into the final packaging.

The production of leads was extremely complicated and labor intensive. The Villalba facility was the only Medtronic facility manufacturing leads in high volume. Leads manufacturing was an almost completely manual process, performed within tight tolerances, and required skilled labor to join raw materials using lasers and adhesives. It could take up to several weeks to manufacture a single lead, and there could be over 100 steps in the manufacturing process. Each manufacturing step, after the first, began with a review of the quality of the work performed in the prior step. The manufacturing process for even the subassembly of a single portion of a lead, such as the outer assembly of the lead, comprised approximately 20 steps. In addition to interim quality reviews, there were as many as 50 quality tests throughout the leads manufacturing process, depending on the complexity of the particular lead. The leads operations maintained a detailed

 The leads operations were responsible for specifying, purchasing, validating, and installing the equipment needed to manufacture leads. Neuro leads did not use any components from MMC or MECC. Some equipment used in manufacturing leads was custom designed to specifications established by the leads operations and built specifically for the leads operations. New equipment was subject to testing and required not only Medtronic but FDA and other regulatory agency approval before it could be used in the manufacturing process.

For a new Neuro product, product feature, or technology, Neuro research evaluated whether the desired outcome for a physician and a patient could be obtained and then developed a product platform. PD&T had engineers and others who worked on software and circuits and participated on Neuro development teams. PD&T worked with core operations on operational strategies for product development and manufacturing. Neuro also did design verification in engineering laboratories in Minnesota. An organization within PD&T handled technology projects, i.e. research and exploratory activities on unproven ideas before formal product development.

Neuro sales representatives were hired on the basis of their level of compassion, experience, and communication skills. Training for Neuro sales representatives was extensive and included various stages, such as ongoing continuing education and evaluations of up-to-date knowledge of current technology. Multistage training was crucial for supporting physicians during implants. The representatives had to be aware of clinical studies and product specifications. Neuro sales representatives, who typically had seen more implants than most physicians, were the clinical and technical experts with Neuro\rquote s technology.

 Physicians consulted with the sales representatives about implants. Sales representatives and physicians worked together to ensure that the device parts fit together and were positioned properly. An implant did not take place without the effective participation of a Neuro sales representative. These representatives needed the courage to speak up during an implant if it was not being done correctly. Neuro sales representatives participated in the postimplant programming of a device and educated the patient on how to use the technology. The quality of credible advice given by a trusted Neuro sales representative to physicians was essential to maintaining Neuro\rquote s brand and the physician\rquote s reputation for using safe and effective devices.

 Pacesetter. Pacesetter was facing an injunction barring it from selling its own rate-responsive pacemakers. In the fall of 1991 through spring of 1992 Medtronic US and Pacesetter reached a resolution of the lawsuits and negotiated the Pacesetter agreement and the settlement agreement. After a tentative deal had been reached on May 26, 1992, Medtronic US\rquote  senior vice president and general counsel presented the proposed terms to Medtronic\rquote s board of directors, recommending that Medtronic accept the deal.

The experience of another company, Telectronics, is a further example of significant product quality problems that had devastating effects on companies in the implantable medical device industry. In 1994 Telectronics encountered a quality problem related to its Accufix-J lead, which, in certain instances, literally punctured the heart and caused patient deaths. Telectronics\rquote  recall of its Accufix-J lead caused its U.S. sales to fall by over 50% between 1994 and 1995 and its market share to fall by almost 50% over that same period. In May 1995 the FDA issued a consent decree to Telectronics that remained in effect until June 1996, requesting that Telectronics halt the shipment of all of its IPGs and associated leads to U.S. customers. Telectronics was no longer a viable company and was eventually acquired by St. Jude.

 In 2005 Medtronic issued a recall of certain of its Marquis family of ICD and CRT devices because of a problem that sometimes led to the battery\rquote s draining too quickly. This caused a concern that the Marquis ICD or CRT might fail to deliver appropriate therapy when the patient needed it, a failure which could be fatal. The Marquis recall forced Medtronic to divert significant research, development, and other resources to address the underlying problem. Physicians paid careful attention to Medtronic\rquote s response to the Marquis problem to ensure that it had been resolved and would not be \u8220\'3fcarried forward into other products that * * * [they] were implanting.\u8221\'3f The Marquis recall was the first significant recall in the implantable medical device industry in almost a decade. The only reason that Medtronic did not lose market share as a result of the Marquis problem was that its competitor, Guidant, sustained a rash of recalls of its own as a result of product quality problems during the same time period. Medtronic nevertheless faced significant class-action litigation on account of the Marquis recall and sustained substantial out-of-pocket product liability expenses per year during 2005 and 2006 (in addition to legal costs) related to that litigation. Medtronic ultimately settled the Marquis class-action litigation. MPROC bore these out-of-pocket costs for the Marquis devices it made.

 Shortly after the Marquis recall in 2005, Guidant, the clear-cut second-leading implantable medical device manufacturer, issued a series of recalls related to its Prizm family of ICDs. Guidant recalled over 60,000 ICDs following the failure of these ICDs to deliver therapy appropriately to patients. Following these recalls Guidant\rquote s ICD and CRT market share declined from 38% to 25%, and Guidant experienced a reduction of approximately 21% of its originally anticipated sale price to Johnson & Johnson. While Boston Scientific ultimately acquired Guidant, Boston Scientific\rquote s market share then languished between 22% and 28% through 2010. Boston Scientific also recorded goodwill impairment charges of over $2 billion associated with its U.S. cardiac rhythm business unit, and was forced to pay more than $550 million to settle the various civil and criminal claims related to Guidant\rquote s 2005 ICD recalls.

 quality problem. One patient, for example, was shocked 42 times consecutively during a camping trip and had to have his Fidelis lead \u8220\'3fimmediately explanted\u8221\'3f. Some patients died as a result of the inappropriate shocks. Approximately 200,000 patients had been implanted with Fidelis leads at the time of the recall. The product quality problem underlying the Fidelis leads posed immense challenges to the physicians who had implanted the leads, as they were forced not only to address the needs of their affected patients but also to explant many of the affected Fidelis leads. Medtronic voluntarily suspended distribution of the Fidelis leads.

The Fidelis recall had a profound effect on Medtronic, severely harming Medtronic\rquote s reputation with physicians. It caused Medtronic to reduce its sales force significantly on account of the contraction in the overall ICD market due to the collective product quality problems of Medtronic and Guidant. The Fidelis recall further contributed to a marked decrease in the number of initial implants in the ICD and CRT market, which had not yet recovered more than five years later. The Fidelis recall also cost Medtronic vast sums of money attributable to increased replacement implants. The Fidelis recall caused Medtronic to lose billions in market capitalization in the days following the recall. While Medtronic had over a 50% market share in the CRT space just before the Fidelis problem transpired,

 MPROC suspected that there might be quality problems related to the Fidelis leads when it began production, because it experienced much lower yields in manufacturing Fidelis initially, which can be symptomatic of potential product quality problems. Once high-volume production had commenced, MPROC\rquote s manufacturing engineers continued to suggest design and manufacturing refinements that, although incorporated, were not enough to stave off the recall. The Fidelis quality problems involved both design and manufacturing.

Because of the recalls in the industry in the mid-2000s, physicians began to increasingly divide their use of devices among the various companies. This was referred to as the \u8220\'3fsplitter mentality\u8221\'3f. Physicians did not want all their patients to have the same device in case there was a recall.

EY determined what petitioner considered to be an arm\rquote s-length royalty rate for the devices and leads licenses as well as for the trademark licenses.

Respondent was concerned that too much profit was being shifted to MPROC. He made adjustments based on a report of IRS industry economist Jeff Goodman titled \u8220\'3fEconomic Analysis of Intercompany Transactions between Medtronic Inc. and Medtronic Puerto Rico Operations Company\u8221\'3f. Goodman\rquote s report concluded that the CUT was not the best method for the intangibles licensed to MPROC.

The purpose of the profit split methodology was to test the results of the transactions among the related parties and ensure that MPROC\rquote s profits were within a range agreed upon with the Commissioner. Specifically, the agreed system profit for MPROC was 38% for devices and 45% for leads, with the acceptable range extending to 3% on either side of the target\u8212\'3f35%-41% for devices and 42%-48% for leads. Medtronic and respondent agreed in the Puerto Rico MOU that they would apply the Puerto Rico MOU to 2002 and all future years and that Medtronic would apply the \u8220\'3fagreed royalty rates on its as filed tax returns, and the Internal Revenue Service would respect those royalty rates, as long as there are no significant changes in any underlying facts\u8221\'3f.

Both parties presented experts to support their respective positions. For experts, we focus on the degree to which their opinions are supported by the evidence. Accordingly, our opinion is not based on comparing their qualifications, and so we do not list or discuss their qualifications, as listing them would unnecessarily lengthen the opinion. We do not use titles because we do not wish to imply a greater deference to academic experts than to industry experts. We do not discuss the opinion of any expert which does not pertain to our factual conclusions.

Petitioner also contends that respondent\rquote s allocations in the notice of deficiency using the CPM are much greater than arm\rquote s length and are therefore arbitrary, capricious, and unreasonable. Specifically, petitioner argues that respondent\rquote s value chain approach fails to respect and view separately the intercompany transactions between MPROC, Medtronic US, and Med USA. Petitioner also contends that respondent did not adequately consider that product quality determines success in the implantable medical device industry and that MPROC is ultimately responsible as the manufacturer of class III finished medical devices.

The profit potential of an intangible is most reliably measured by directly calculating the net present value of the benefits to be realized (on the basis of prospective profits to be realized or costs to be saved) through the use of subsequent transfers of the intangible, considering the capital investment and startup expenses required, the risks to be assumed, and other relevant considerations.

The problems are particularly acute in the case of transfers of high-profit potential intangibles. Taxpayers may transfer such intangibles to foreign related corporations or to possession corporations at an early stage, for a relatively low royalty, and take the position that it was not possible at the time of the transfers to predict the subsequent success of the product. Even in the case of a proven high-profit intangible, taxpayers frequently take the position that intercompany royalty rates may appropriately be set on the basis of industry norms for transfers of much less profitable items.

In requiring that payments be commensurate with the income stream, the bill does not intend to mandate the use of the \u8220\'3fcontract manufacturer\u8221\'3f or \u8220\'3fcost-plus\u8221\'3f methods of allocating income or any other particular method. As under present law, all the facts and circumstances are to be considered in determining what pricing methods are appropriate in cases involving intangible property, including the extent to which the transferee bears real risks with respect to its ability to make a profit from the intangible or, instead, sells products produced with the intangible largely to related parties (which may involve little sales risk or activity) and has a market essentially dependent, on, or assured by, such related parties\rquote  marketing efforts. However, the profit or income stream generated by or associated with intangible property is to be given primary weight.

 Looking at the income related to the intangible and splitting it according to relative economic contributions is consistent with what unrelated parties do. The general goal of the commensurate with income standard is, therefore, to ensure that each party earns the income or return from the intangible that an unrelated party would earn in an arm\rquote s length transfer of the intangible.

The principal focus of Heimert\rquote s analysis was to determine the arm\rquote s-length returns for MPROC operations versus those of Medtronic US and Med USA. His analysis considered each party\rquote s functions, assets, and risks that were related to the CRDM and Neuro businesses for the U.S. market. For example, if petitioner earned $100 of profit in the CRDM or Neuro value chain, Heimert evaluated how

 The purpose of Heimert\rquote s analysis is to determine the arm\rquote s-length returns and associated profits for MPROC\rquote s operations versus Medtronic US and Med USA. Heimert used the CPM and concluded that this method provides MPROC with a return for its finished-product manufacturing that is consistent with the returns earned by comparable manufacturers in the medical device industry. He also concluded that the CPM establishes the return to Medtronic US for its contributions to the U.S. CRDM and Neuro value chain by subtracting the operating profits attributed to MPROC from the overall value chain operating profits and allowing the remainder to accrue to Medtronic US.

MPROC\rquote s reported results for 2005 and 2006 far exceeded the median calculated by Heimert.

He sought to identify comparable companies to benchmark the routine portion of Medtronic US\rquote  component manufacturing and sales. His position is that nonroutine aspects of Medtronic US\rquote  component manufacturing and sales were compensated through the royalty payment.

 a quality problem. This recall caused petitioner\rquote s market share percentage to fall from the mid-70s to the high 30s. Second, in 2005 petitioner had to recall some of its Marquis devices. Petitioner did not lose its market share, likely because its competitor, Guidant, also sustained a rash of recalls due to product quality problems during the same time period. Regardless, petitioner still faced significant class-action litigation and settlement expenses because of the recall. Third, in 2007 petitioner had to recall its Sprint Fidelis ICD leads because of a quality problem that would cause the leads to inappropriately shock patients\rquote  hearts. This recall had a severe impact on petitioner and the industry, causing petitioner to lose a significant amount of market share, as well as severely damaged consumer confidence.

 Respondent does not place enough emphasis on the importance of quality in the industry. The final product is the key to success. Product quality is the foundation for which implantable medical devices can be successful. A recall could make it very difficult for a company to continue to compete in the industry at the same level. A company can have a strong sales force and a creative marketing department, but these will not make a difference if the underlying product is unsafe and ineffective.

Respondent contends that quality was important to petitioner in its entirety, and not just to MPROC specifically. Respondent contends that quality was established at petitioner\rquote s headquarters in the United States and implemented by the disparate business units, including those at MPROC. Respondent points to the fact that quality was always on the executive committee meetings agenda and that CRDM and Neuro both had quality officers in the United States. Respondent argues that MPROC\rquote s role in quality was not unique and cannot explain MPROC\rquote s profits. Accordingly, Heimert\rquote s comparables spread out the quality risk throughout the entire value chain, in contrast to petitioner\rquote s focus on risk associated with final assembly at MPROC.

Petitioner contends that MPROC \u8220\'3flike the ancient Roman Hero, Horatio, represents the last line of defense before a potential product quality issue\u8221\'3f. As discussed above, a product quality problem could not only harm petitioner within the industry, but could fatally harm the user. Even though a salesperson reviews the product before insertion, a problem should be detected at an earlier point. The finished product had to be of the highest quality, and that quality assurance was MPROC\rquote s responsibility. MPROC was exposed to being sued if there was a defect in the manufactured device.

The CAPA program ensured continuous improvement to the quality and effectiveness of MPROC\rquote s products and its manufacturing operations. Other quality systems included: incoming inspection; sterilization; the environmental, health, and safety function; process excellence; the product traceability process; nonconformance evaluations; internal audits; product hold orders; management reviews; and the management of material review requests.

A main focus of the advisory council was quality. The council comprised the vice presidents of operations from the various business units that operated in Puerto Rico, plus the Puerto Rico general manager.

 MPROC also had quality control teams for each of its operations. These teams had significant responsibility, and were very involved in the entire manufacturing process. The quality control teams at each of the operations were solely responsible for developing the validation, inspection, and qualification steps necessary to ensure that the final manufactured devices and leads met the established specifications.

 The devices and leads licenses included specific wording which addressed quality. The quality control standards and specifications were to be established jointly by MPROC and Medtronic US. Neuro, CRDM, and MPROC all had their own quality manuals. The MPROC manual was consistent with the other manuals, but had specific guidelines for MPROC. Under the terms of the licenses MPROC was required to take corrective actions as necessary to restore quality to the appropriate level in the event of quality control failure.

The fact that quality was important to the entire company does not mean MPROC\rquote s role in quality should be diminished. With these types of implantable devices, it is reasonable that the executives would be focused on quality. Executives\rquote  focus on quality, however, does not lessen the impact that MPROC had on quality. If MPROC did not meet high quality standards, it would not matter that the rest of the company was meeting the standards. MPROC was making devices and leads that were implanted in a human body and was responsible for ensuring that the manufactured devices and leads were of the highest quality. This process is very different from manufacturing electronic equipment such as a cell phone. If a cell phone malfunctions, the consumer could be inconvenienced; if a device or lead malfunctions, the consumer could die.

Petitioner contends that since MPROC was responsible for assembling the final product, the importance of quality was vital. MPROC took all of the components and supplies received from MMC, MECC, and third-party suppliers and incorporated them into class III finished medical devices capable of improving or saving lives. MPROC had the responsibility of making sure that every component was combined to provide repeated and reliable patient therapy all the time.

 class III finished medical devices, enabling a safe product to be made. For example, MPROC focused on Lean Sigma manufacturing in order to eliminate waste when moving from a low production level to a high production level. MPROC engineers worked to ensure that finished products could be produced at a certain rate. There was no room for error. For run yield testing to be successful, it had to be 100%, i.e., each device had to be perfect.

MPROC differed from the makers of components. Components manufacturers are not manufacturers with FDA-registered facilities because they do not make finished products that are implanted in a human body. MPROC on the other hand was an FDA-registered facility responsible for putting together sophisticated medical devices that would remain in the human body for years. All the components might be made perfectly, but there could be problems if they are not put together perfectly.

Heimert used 14 comparable companies to determine MPROC\rquote s return for manufacturing. Petitioner\rquote s expert Robert S. Pindyck criticized Heimert\rquote s comparables. His report explained that not all companies used as comparables manufacture devices similar to MPROC\rquote s. Many of the products made by the comparable companies do not require the same level of FDA scrutiny as implantable class III medical devices.

Distinct products could have differing risk profiles, which may result in different level of profits attributable to the manufacturer. For example, one of the companies that Heimert identified as comparable manufactures orthopedic devices that include nonsurgical and minimally invasive surgical products. The risk associated with these products would likely be less than the risk associated with MPROC\rquote s products\u8212\'3fa nonsurgical product can be easily replaced, whereas it is extremely difficult, or even fatal, to replace the lead of a pacemaker.

Pindyck was critical of this valuation and testified that it is not easy to value the assets of a company such as MPROC. For example, he discussed what would happen if a natural disaster destroyed the MPROC facilities. He described this type of event as devastating and explained that it would take two or more years to rebuild operations to the prior level. He indicated that this type of catastrophe would result in Medtronic\rquote s losing market share.

Pindyck\rquote s focus was on step of 4 of Heimert\rquote s analysis. He specifically criticized the 14 companies Heimert identified as comparable to MPROC for determining profitability. He explains that Heimert\rquote s ROA estimates are calculated using aggregated financials corresponding to nonmanufacturing functions not performed by MPROC and representing manufacturing across other product types not manufactured by MPROC.

 Pindyck believes the Heimert analysis does not correctly calculate the ROA because Heimert looked at the value of the buildings, equipment, and inventory. Heimert, however, did not look at the value of MPROC as an operation. Pindyck testified that MPROC is more valuable than just buildings and equipment, and the entire operation needs to be considered. Pindyck concludes that the ROA is not the best approach.

In the instant case aggregating the transactions did not result in a reasonable determination of true taxable income. The Heimert aggregations resulted in assigning a value to MPROC\rquote s functions and allocating a system profit to MPROC. The resulting system profits allocated to MPROC were not reasonable because Heimert allocated an unreasonably small percentage of the profits to MPROC. Therefore, aggregation was not the most reliable means of determining arm\rquote s-length consideration for the controlled transactions.

MPROC did more than assemble components. MPROC had the responsibility of taking all the third-party suppliers\rquote  components and incorporating them into class III medical devices.

The Heimert analysis and respondent\rquote s resulting position do not give the appropriate weight to the role of MPROC. Respondent\rquote s adjusted royalty rate attributes only 6%-8% of the profits to MPROC. This attribution is not reasonable. It is difficult to place an exact value on what MPROC contributed to the manufacturing of devices and leads, but it is certainly more than the 8%-12% value attributed by Heimert.

Petitioner contends that the Pacesetter agreement is the best comparable transaction. As part of the Pacesetter agreement, petitioner and Pacesetter agreed to cross-license their pacemaker and ICD patent portfolios. The Pacesetter agreement covered some of the same intangibles that were licensed to MPROC. Pacesetter agreed to pay Medtronic US $50 million up front and $25 million in royalty prepayments upon execution of the agreement. Pacesetter agreed to pay Medtronic a 7% royalty on the retail sale in the United States of all cardiac stimulation devices or components.

 During his testimony Berneman explained adjustments made to the Pacesetter agreement. These adjustments were not described in his expert report. He doubled the royalty rate of 7% -14% to address exclusivity. Then he added 2%-3% as described above for know-how, giving a rate of 16%-17%. He explained that there would be an upward pressure on the royalty rate because Medtronic is obligated in the license agreement to continue to provide regulatory affairs assistance. He further explained that there would also be downward pressures. The first downward pressure is petitioner had total leverage in the Pacesetter agreement because Pacesetter\rquote s products had been found to have infringed and were subject to being enjoined. The second downward pressure is the license to MPROC is not exclusive because Medtronic had already granted licenses to major market competitors for some of the patents. Berneman concluded the royalty rate for the Pacesetter agreement as a comparable is 16%-17% (retail).

The Berneman report focused on seven comparable agreements. It appears that six were related to CRDM products. Berneman did not make adjustments based on technology, and he did not explain why such adjustments were not necessary. Some of the comparables, including the Pacesetter agreement, included a lump sum agreement. Berneman did not make upward adjustments to the royalty rates of any of his comparables to account for lump-sum payments.

Berneman\rquote s broad range of 0.5%-20% is unconvincing and vague. For example, in one of Berneman\rquote s comparable transactions, petitioner entered into an agreement for technology for both implantable and nonimplantable medical applications, including CRDM and Neuro. The royalty rates ranged from 2% of the net internal transfer price to 3% of actual selling prices. The report included no adjustments to this comparable even though it seems to be significantly lower than where an arm\rquote s-length rate would be for the devices and leads licenses. We do not consider this to be a comparable transaction because a royalty rate of 2%-3% is not even in the ballpark of what the rate should be for the devices and leads licenses.

Berneman testified that he made a 2%-3% adjustment to the Pacesetter agreement for know-how because the Pacesetter agreement excluded future technology. Berneman provided no further explanation for how the know-how adjustment was calculated. The devices and leads licenses define know-how as all technical information presently available that relates to the product or improvements and information useful for the development, manufacture, or effectiveness of the product. Pacesetter, which later became St. Jude, made and sold products covered by the Pacesetter agreement. The evidence does not support an ongoing relationship between petitioner and Pacesetter whereas the evidence supports an ongoing relationship between Medtronic US and MPROC. Throughout the trial, we heard about the close relationship between Medtronic US and MPROC. Each party benefited from the know-how of the other. Medtronic US was constantly making improvements to products, and MPROC was ensuring the quality of the product and improving the manufacturing.

., if an uncontrolled transaction involves the same transfer of the same intangible under the same, or substantially the same, circumstances as the controlled transaction, the result derived from applying the CUT method will generally be the most direct and reliable measure of arm\rquote s length. The Pacesetter agreement included some of the same intangibles, but the devices and leads licenses included additional intangibles. The Berneman report did not show which intangibles from the Pacesetter agreement were included in the devices and leads licenses.

 had a combined royalty rate for technology and trademark rights ranging from 0% to 15% of net sales. Using the same criteria as for the other licenses, Berneman selected 44 agreements that established separate and distinguishable payment terms for the grant of rights to a trademark or trade name. Each agreement contained trademark royalty rates ranging from 0% to 5% (retail) of net sales. The actual royalty rate contained in the trademark licence agreement is 5.3% of sales (retail), which exceeds the arm\rquote s-length ranges.

Respondent states in his answering brief that \u8220\'3fsuch exercise would be fruitless given that Pacesetter is not comparable in any sense\u8221\'3f. Respondent also criticized petitioner\rquote s method for making separate calculations. Respondent\rquote s expert, however, agreed that two of the covered transactions were arm\rquote s length despite petitioner\rquote s decision to calculate them separately. Respondent only concluded that the intangible property transactions were not arm\rquote s length. We do not think it is necessary to revise all four transactions to reach an arm\rquote s-length result when only one of the four transactions is not arm\rquote s length. We do not agree with respondent that his approach is the best method and that adjustments could not be made to the one troubling area of petitioner\rquote s methodology\u8212\'3fthe royalty rates for the licensing of intangibles for devices and leads. We conclude that appropriate adjustments should be made to petitioner\rquote s CUT.

Specifically, the Pacesetter agreement relates to some of the same products and has similar profit potential. Berneman testified that the Pacesetter agreement was the best comparable because it \u8220\'3fdeals with the same patents, the same market, the same product, in the same time frame for the same customers, and the same profit potential.\u8221\'3f We agree that the Pacesetter agreement is an appropriate CUT because it involved some of the same intangibles and had comparable circumstances.

Petitioner contends that the 7% royalty rate in the Pacesetter agreement is comparable. Petitioner\rquote s expert witness, Berneman, made adjustments to this rate. He applied a 7% increase for exclusivity and 2%-3% increase for know-how. He did not explain in detail the know-how increase, but he testified that it accounts for the grants of rights to future know-how contained in the devices and leads licenses. In the light of his adjustments, we start at 17%.

MPROC maintained an extremely close relationship with Medtronic US. There was a back and forth between MPROC and Medtronic US with a focus on a single goal, making a high-quality product. MPROC had access to the know-how of Medtronic. Pacesetter and its successor, St. Jude, did not have an ongoing relationship with Medtronic. Berneman made an adjustment, which he referred to as know-how, but this adjustment was related to future technology. Berneman made no adjustments for the know-how that Medtronic shared with MPROC. Berneman doubled the Pacesetter royalty rate to account for the exclusivity of the devices and leads licenses. We conclude that the relationship between Medtronic and MPROC provides know-how that is equivalent to the exclusivity in the devices and leads licenses. Accordingly, we increase the Pacesetter royalty rate by 7%.

. In order to account for profit potential, we make an upward adjustment of 3.5%, which is half the value of the Pacesetter agreement. We think that certain of the products included in the devices licenses are very profitable and have led to petitioner\rquote s success. Similarly, the products covered by the Pacesetter agreement have been very profitable, but petitioner was the market leader during the years at issue. While we think that it is important to make an adjustment for profit potential, we think that exclusivity and know-how have a greater impact on the value of the licenses. Without exclusivity the licenses would have significantly less value. MPROC was able to make a product of superior quality because of know-how received from Medtronic US. For this reason we halve the amount of the adjustment for exclusivity and know-how to adjust for profit potential.

 these other comparables. His report failed to make an adequate comparison to the devices licenses. An adjustment is needed to take into account the additional products in the Neuro division and additional CRDM products. Neuro was not as large or as profitable as CRDM. We conclude that a 2.5% upward adjustment, which is slightly more than one-third of the Pacesetter royalty rate, is a proper adjustment.

 In his report Berneman failed to distinguish devices and leads, and he did not have a separate rate. Petitioner contends that 15% is an appropriate royalty rate for the leads licenses, which is approximately half of the 29% royalty rate that petitioner contends is appropriate for the devices licenses. During the years at issue the device operations were substantially more profitable than the leads operations. We conclude that a reasonable royalty rate for the leads licenses would be 22%, half of the 44% that we determined for the devices licenses.

With the aforementioned adjustments, the CUT method is the best method for determining the arm\rquote s-length rate. We note that our adjustments result in rates that are close to the rates that the parties previously negotiated in the MOU. This is coincidental. The adjustments were not made to mimic the MOU but rather to reflect the facts and expert testimony.
