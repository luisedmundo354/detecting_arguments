U.S., C.A.2 (Conn.) 1976, 568 F.2d 811\n\nNote: The opinion also has the denial of a petition for rehearing, which is not included below.\n\nTIMBERS, Circuit Judge:\n\nThe questions here presented under the corporate reorganization provisions of the Internal Revenue Code appear to be of first impression, at least in this Circuit.\n\nThe corporate taxpayer, The Aetna Casualty and Surety Company, appeals from a judgment entered December 10, 1975 in the District of Connecticut, M. Joseph Blumenfeld, District Judge, 403 F.Supp. 498, granting the government's motion for summary judgment[1] and dismissing the complaint in a tax refund action brought by the taxpayer to recover federal corporate income taxes and interest for the taxable year 1963 in amount of $4,467,630.59 claimed to have been erroneously assessed and collected.\n\nThe central question is whether the corporate taxpayer, which was a subsidiary organized by its parent solely for the purpose of acquiring the assets and business of one of the parent's other subsidiaries, should be allowed as a deduction its post-reorganization net operating losses as carrybacks against the pre-reorganization income of its predecessor under \u00a7\u00a7 172 and 381(b)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code.[2] 815*815 The answer to this question turns on whether the reorganization qualified as \"a mere change in identity [or] form\" within the meaning of \u00a7 368(a)(1)(F).[3]\n\nFor the reasons below, we hold that the reorganization did qualify as a \u00a7 368(a)(1)(F) reorganization and that the taxpayer should be allowed to carry back its losses against the pre-reorganization income of its predecessor pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 172 and 381(b)(3). Accordingly we reverse the judgment of the district court and remand with directions to enter judgment for the taxpayer.\n\nI. FACTS AND PRIOR PROCEEDINGS\n\nIn view of the district court's clear, comprehensive and detailed statement of the facts, 403 F.Supp. at 500-04, it is sufficient for our purpose to summarize only the essential facts believed necessary to an understanding of our rulings on the questions presented.[4] The facts are not in dispute.\n\n(A) Prior Proceedings\n\nAetna Life Insurance Company (Aetna Life) is a Connecticut corporation which writes and sells life, accident and health insurance. Prior to December 29, 1964 Aetna Life held 61.61% of the outstanding voting common stock of The Aetna Casualty and Surety Company (Old Aetna), a Connecticut corporation which wrote and sold liability, fire, theft, property damage and surety insurance. In November or December 1964 Aetna Life organized Farmington Valley Insurance Company (Farmington Valley), a Connecticut corporation which was a wholly owned shell subsidiary with no business or assets of its own, for the sole purpose of acquiring the business and assets of Old Aetna. On December 29, 1964 Old Aetna was merged into Farmington Valley in a complex, three-party reorganization described more fully below. As a result of this merger and the related stock transfers, minority shareholders of Old Aetna received shares of Aetna Life in return for their Old Aetna shares and the shares of Farmington Valley were placed in trust for the shareholders of Aetna Life. The name of Farmington Valley later was changed to The Aetna Casualty and Surety Company (New Aetna), plaintiff herein.\n\nPursuant to the loss carryback provisions of the Code, New Aetna sought to carry 816*816 back its net operating losses for the taxable period December 30 through 31, 1964 and the calendar year 1965 against the net income of Old Aetna for the calendar year 1963 and the period January 1 through December 29, 1964.[5]\n\nThe IRS allowed New Aetna to carry back the $7,213,547 net operating loss allocated to the period prior to the December 29, 1964 reorganization, see note 5, supra, to offset a part of Old Aetna's 1963 taxable income; but no part of New Aetna's net operating losses for the periods subsequent to December 29, 1964 was allowed as a carryback to offset Old Aetna's other 1963 taxable income.\n\nAs a result of the disallowance of the latter New Aetna paid federal income taxes for the calendar year 1963 in amount of $4,071,655.21, plus deficiency interest of $395,975.38. New Aetna filed a timely claim for refund to recover the sum of these two amounts ($4,467,630.59) plus statutory interest.\n\nFollowing the disallowance of New Aetna's refund claim, the instant action was commenced on August 14, 1973 in the District of Connecticut. Jurisdiction was invoked under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346(a) (1970). Both sides moved for summary judgment. The court, having found after a hearing that there was no dispute as to the material facts, filed an opinion on October 15, 1975, 403 F.Supp. 498, granting the government's motion for summary judgment and denying the taxpayer's motion for summary judgment. From the judgment entered December 10, 1975 dismissing the complaint, the instant appeal has been taken.\n\n(B) December 29, 1964 Merger\n\nIn order better to focus on the corporate reorganization of December 29, 1964 which is at the core of this case, it is necessary to back up a bit and review certain events which led to that reorganization.\n\nAs a result of the Life Insurance Company Income Tax Act of 1959, Pub.L. No. 86-69, \u00a7 2(a), 73 Stat. 112, the federal income tax liability of insurance companies such as Aetna Life depended in part on the value of the assets held by the company. The greater the value of the company's assets, the greater the portion of its income which was subject to tax. See \u00a7\u00a7 802(a)(1) and (b), 804(a)(1), 805(a)(1), (b)(2)(B), and (b)(4). Understandably, Aetna Life wished to remove its 61.61% ownership of Old Aetna from its tax base.\n\nAetna Life also wished to achieve an identity of ownership between the shareholders of Aetna Life and those of Old Aetna. Although the officers and directors of the two companies had been identical for several years prior to the reorganization, they had fiduciary duties to different groups of shareholders because of Aetna Life's 61.61% stock interest in Old Aetna. This prevented the two companies from further integrating their operations, from selling insurance together, and from taking other business steps which might have achieved operational economies. The diverse stock ownership of the two companies also required elaborate cost allocation accounting procedures.\n\nThe obvious way for Aetna Life to remove Old Aetna from its tax base would 817*817 have been for Aetna Life to distribute its Old Aetna stock to the Aetna Life shareholders. This would have resulted in taxable income to Aetna Life under \u00a7 802(b)(3) which makes certain portions of distributions to shareholders taxable to the life insurance company. See \u00a7\u00a7 815(a)(1) and (b)(3).\n\nAetna Life therefore sought to persuade Congress to amend these provisions of the Code. In 1964 Congress enacted the Act of September 2, 1964, Pub.L. No. 88-571, \u00a7 4(a)(2), 78 Stat. 859, which added, inter alia, what is now \u00a7 815(f)(3)(B) of the Code.[6] This provided two avenues by which Aetna Life could distribute its Old Aetna stock without incurring tax liability to itself. \u00a7 815(f)(3)(B)(i) excluded from the definition of taxable distributions certain distributions of the stock of an 80% controlled corporation which is an insurance company if the distributing corporation obtained such control pursuant to a \u00a7 368(a)(1)(B) reorganization (stock for stock exchange) and if the distributing corporation at all times owned more than 50% of the controlled corporation. \u00a7 815(f)(3)(B)(ii) excluded from the definition of taxable distributions certain distributions of the stock of a 100% controlled insurance corporation provided (i) that control was obtained in exchange for the distributing corporation's own stock; (ii) that the controlled corporation immediately exchanged the distributing corporation's stock to a third corporation in a \u00a7 368(a)(1)(A) reorganization (statutory merger or consolidation) or a \u00a7 368(a)(1)(C) reorganization (exchange of stock for assets); and (iii) that the distributing corporation had owned at least 50% of the third corporation's voting stock.\n\nIn order to bring itself within the provisions of the new law and thus avoid incurring tax liability to itself as a result of distributing its Old Aetna stock to its shareholders, Aetna Life devised a plan substantially as follows:\n\nAetna Life would organize Farmington Valley as a wholly owned shell subsidiary with no business of its own. Aetna Life would issue 13,300,000 shares of its voting common stock and exchange them for all 1,000 shares of Farmington Valley. Then, pursuant to a reorganization plan to be approved by the shareholders of Farmington Valley and Old Aetna, Farmington Valley would exchange its Aetna Life stock for the voting common stock held by Old Aetna shareholders in the ratio of 1.9 shares of Aetna Life stock for each share of Old Aetna stock. Aetna Life would retire the Aetna Life stock which it received in return for its 61.61% stock interest in Old Aetna. Farmington Valley would cancel its newly acquired Old Aetna stock. Then by operation 818*818 of Connecticut's merger law Farmington Valley would succeed to all of the assets and liabilities of Old Aetna. Farmington Valley would change its name to The Aetna Casualty and Surety Company (New Aetna). Under that name New Aetna would carry on the business of Old Aetna. Aetna Life would distribute the 1,000 shares of Farmington Valley (now New Aetna) by putting them into a trust for the benefit of the Aetna Life shareholders. Evidence of a proportional beneficial interest in the trust would be stapled to each Aetna Life share so that both the Aetna Life shares and its proportional beneficial interest of New Aetna shares in the trust would always be held by the same owner.\n\nOn October 21, 1964 the Connecticut Insurance Commissioner approved the plan.\n\nOn October 23, 1964 the IRS issued a number of rulings which had been requested by Aetna Life with respect to the plan, including the following: that the merger of Old Aetna into Farmington Valley and the transfer of Aetna Life stock held by Farmington Valley to Old Aetna's shareholders would constitute a \u00a7 368(a)(1)(C) reorganization; and that the transfer by Aetna Life of its New Aetna stock to a trustee for the benefit of Aetna Life shareholders would be non-taxable to Aetna Life and its shareholders under \u00a7\u00a7 355 and 311.\n\nOn November 24, 1964 the shareholders of Aetna Life and Old Aetna approved the plan. The reorganization was carried out on December 29, 1964.\n\n(C) Claims In District Court And Rulings Thereon\n\nIn support of the taxpayer's claim that it was entitled to carry back its post-reorganization operating losses against the pre-reorganization income of Old Aetna under \u00a7\u00a7 172 and 381(b)(3), New Aetna made three basic arguments in the district court. First, it argued that the transactions pursuant to which it merged with Old Aetna did not constitute a \"reorganization\" within the meaning of \u00a7\u00a7 368 and 381, but merely a \"redemption\" of the minority shareholders' interest in Old Aetna. Casco Products Corp., 49 T.C. 32 (1967), appeal dismissed, No. 32261 (2 Cir., June 11, 1968). Second, it argued that, even if there was a \"reorganization,\" the merger of Old Aetna into New Aetna constituted a \u00a7 368(a)(1)(B) reorganization even if it also constituted a reorganization under \u00a7 368(a)(1)(C), and that \u00a7 381(b)(3) does not prohibit carrybacks in the case of a \u00a7 368(a)(1)(B) reorganization.[7] Third, it argued that the merger of Old Aetna into the shell which later became New Aetna was a \"mere change in identity [or] form\" within the meaning of \u00a7 368(a)(1)(F) and that New Aetna therefore was entitled to the carryback under \u00a7 381(b)(3), which expressly excludes (F) reorganizations from the prohibition against carrybacks.\n\nJudge Blumenfeld held that the merger of Old Aetna into New Aetna was a \"reorganization\"; that the transactions did constitute a \u00a7 368(a)(1)(C) reorganization; and that the merger of Old Aetna into the new shell which became New Aetna was not a \"mere change in identity [or] form\" within the meaning of \u00a7 368(a)(1)(F). In holding that the merger did not qualify as an (F) reorganization, the judge acknowledged that a reorganization could be an (F) reorganization while at the same time falling within one of the other classes of reorganizations defined by \u00a7 368(a)(1). He held however that the instant reorganization did not qualify as an (F) reorganization because during its course there was a shift in the ownership of Old Aetna. In support of this holding the judge emphasized the fact that the 38.39% minority shareholders were forced to exchange their Old Aetna stock for Aetna Life stock, together with the 819*819 interest in New Aetna which they received as a result of Aetna Life's placing the New Aetna stock in a trust for the benefit of Aetna Life shareholders.\n\nII. INTERNAL REVENUE CODE PROVISIONS AND THEIR APPLICATION TO THIS REORGANIZATION\n\n(A) Code Provisions\n\nIn view of the complexity of the Code provisions here involved, a brief summary of the relevant provisions, and their interrelationship one to the other, may be helpful to an understanding of our rulings below.\n\n\u00a7 172 provides generally that a corporation may carry back its net operating losses against the three preceding years' income and that it may carry over such losses to five succeeding years until they are exhausted.[8] In allowing corporations to spread losses over a nine year period, \u00a7 172 is intended to equalize the tax treatment of a corporation whose income may fluctuate from year to year with that of other corporations whose incomes may be relatively constant.\n\n\u00a7 381 deals with carrybacks and carryovers where there has been a corporate \"reorganization\" as that term is defined in \u00a7 368(a)(1). \u00a7 381(b)(3) provides that \u2014 except for reorganizations under \u00a7 368(a)(1)(F) (\"a mere change in identity, form or place of organization, however effected\") \u2014 the acquiring corporation \"in a distribution or transfer described in subsection (a)\" may not carry back its losses against the pre-acquisition income of the acquired corporation. Since \u00a7 381(a) does not apply to reorganizations under \u00a7 368(a)(1)(B) (acquisition by one corporation of the controlling interest in another corporation in exchange for its own or its parent's stock) or under \u00a7 368(a)(1)(E) (recapitalizations), the prohibition of \u00a7 381(b)(3) against carryback does not apply to those types of reorganizations. \u00a7 381(b)(3) does prohibit carrybacks after reorganizations under \u00a7 368(a)(1)(A) (statutory merger or consolidation).[9] \u00a7 368(a)(1)(C) (acquisition by one corporation of substantially all of the assets of another in exchange for the stock of the acquiring corporation or its parent), and \u00a7 368(a)(1)(D) (transfer of assets of one corporation to another where the transferor or its shareholders control the transferee and the transferor distributes to its shareholders its stock in the transferee) \u2014 unless the reorganization also qualifies as \"a mere change in identity [or] form\" under \u00a7 368(a)(1)(F).\n\n\u00a7 381(b)(3) does not prevent the acquiring corporation from carrying back its losses against its own pre-reorganization income, even if those losses resulted from the operations of the non-surviving corporation. The purpose of \u00a7 381(b)(3) was to provide a hard and fast rule that the acquiring corporation may not carry back losses to the pre-reorganization tax years of the transferor corporation \u2014 unless the acquisition qualifies as a \u00a7 368(a)(1)(F) reorganization. \u00a7 381(b)(3) avoids the need for divisional accounting and prevents the manipulation that would result if the acquiring corporation were allowed to apportion current losses between the operations acquired from each of the predecessor corporations.\n\n\u00a7 368, which defines various types of \"reorganizations\", depends for its effect on other provisions of the Code. \u00a7 354 provides (with qualifications) that there shall be no gain or loss to shareholders who exchange their stock in one corporation for stock in another corporation pursuant to a plan of \"reorganization\" between the corporations. Under \u00a7 361 a corporation does not realize a gain or sustain a loss when it 820*820 transfers its assets to another corporation in exchange for stock in the other corporation pursuant to a plan of reorganization. See also \u00a7\u00a7 356, 357, 358, 361, 362(b) and 381.\n\nPrior to the 1954 revision of the Code, the lines of demarcation between what are now \u00a7 368(a)(1)(F) reorganizations and other types of reorganizations under \u00a7 368(a)(1) were not nearly as significant as the boundaries between reorganizations in general and transactions which did not qualify as reorganizations. Under \u00a7\u00a7 354 and 361 certain transactions were tax free if carried out pursuant to a plan of reorganization. Distributions to shareholders might be taxed at capital gains rates if made as part of a corporate \"liquidation\", while certain distributions of corporate profits to shareholders pursuant to \"reorganizations\" could be taxed as regular income.\n\nIn 1954 Congress completely revised the Code. With the addition of \u00a7 381 and the significance of \u00a7 368(a)(1)(F) to the operation of the carryback and accounting provisions of \u00a7 381,[10] it became more important to delineate the boundaries between a \u00a7 368(a)(1)(F) reorganization and other types of reorganizations than previously had been the case. Reef Corp. v. Commissioner, 368 F.2d 125, 136 (5 Cir. 1966), cert. denied, 386 U.S. 1018 (1967).\n\nUnlike the other subsections of \u00a7 368(a)(1) which contain definitions of various types of reorganizations, \u00a7 368(a)(1)(F) on its face says very little. What may be \"a mere change in identity [or] form\" for one purpose may not be for another purpose. At least one other Circuit which has dealt with this provision of the Code, in the context of interpreting the provisions relating to tax-exempt transactions, or determining whether certain corporate transactions constitute liquidations or reorganizations, has assumed that a transaction deemed an (F) reorganization for those purposes must also be an (F) reorganization for purposes of \u00a7 381. E. g., Estate of Stauffer v. Commissioner, 403 F.2d 611, 619 (9 Cir. 1968); but see Gordon v. Commissioner, 424 F.2d 378, 384 (2 Cir.), cert. denied, 400 U.S. 848 (1970). That is a matter we need not decide in the instant case.\n\n(B) Claims In Court of Appeals And Our Rulings Thereon\n\nStripped to its essentials, the critical elements of the reorganization here involved were the following: Aetna Life owned 61.61% of Old Aetna. Aetna Life organized New Aetna (then Farmington Valley) as a 100% owned subsidiary solely to acquire Old Aetna. New Aetna had no business or assets of its own. New Aetna acquired Old Aetna's assets on December 29, 1964. As an incident of the reorganization, the 38.39% minority shareholders of Old Aetna exchanged their Old Aetna stock for Aetna Life stock. These minority shareholders retained a reduced proprietary interest in the business of the subsidiary upon the distribution by Aetna Life of the New Aetna stock which was placed in a trust for the benefit of Aetna Life shareholders.\n\nNew Aetna argues that this reorganization was a \u00a7 368(a)(1)(B) one. It also argues that \u00a7 381(b)(3) was not intended to apply to a reorganization of this type where the acquiring corporation was a mere shell with no business or tax history of its own.\n\nThe government argues that the reorganization was a \u00a7 368(a)(1)(C) one. It further argues that \u00a7 381(b)(3), including the exception for \u00a7 368(a)(1)(F) reorganizations, was intended to prevent an acquiring corporation from carrying back its losses to offset the acquired corporation's pre-reorganization 821*821 income whenever the reorganization involved a shift in proprietary interests.\n\nWe need not rule upon Aetna's claim that its merger with Old Aetna was a reorganization under \u00a7 368(a)(1)(B) even if it also was covered by \u00a7 368(a)(1)(C), since under the circumstances of this case \u00a7 381(b)(3) does not bar the loss carryback. While the transactions did involve the type of stock-for-stock exchange contemplated by \u00a7 368(a)(1)(B), they also involved acquisition of Old Aetna's assets by New Aetna.\n\nAs the district court recognized, however, reorganizations under \u00a7 368(a)(1)(A)-(E) may qualify also under \u00a7 368(a)(1)(F); and it is well settled that many (F) reorganizations do fit within the types of reorganizations defined by the other subsections of \u00a7 368(a)(1). Gordon v. Commissioner, supra, 424 F.2d at 384; Associated Machine v. Commissioner, 403 F.2d 622, 624 (9 Cir. 1968); Reef Corp. v. Commissioner, supra, 368 F.2d at 136; Davant v. Commissioner, 366 F.2d 874, 883 (5 Cir. 1966), cert. denied, 386 U.S. 1022 (1967); Movielab, Inc. v. United States, 494 F.2d 693, 698-99 (Ct.Cl.1974).\n\nAbsent the shift in the proprietary interests of the minority shareholders of Old Aetna, there would be no basis for contending that the merger of Old Aetna into a shell corporation, which had no business or assets of its own, did not qualify as a \u00a7 368(a)(1)(F) reorganization. The government has acknowledged in the past that such a reorganization is \"a mere change in identity [or] form\" for purposes of \u00a7\u00a7 368(a)(1)(F) and 381(b)(3). E. g., Associated Machine v. Commissioner, supra, 403 F.2d at 624; Movielab, Inc. v. United States, supra, 494 F.2d at 697. The government does not contend to the contrary here. We know of no authority for the proposition that the merger of one corporation into a mere corporate shell does not constitute a \u00a7 368(a)(1)(F) reorganization.\n\nThe government argues, however, that we should reach a different result here merely because the 38.39% minority shareholders of Old Aetna were forced to exchange their Old Aetna stock for Aetna Life stock.[11] We disagree.\n\nAlthough this precise question is presented in the instant case for the first time in this Circuit, similar claims have been made in a number of other cases. In Casco Products Corp. v. Commissioner, supra, the Tax Court dealt with a very similar situation in which a parent corporation merged a subsidiary into a newly organized shell in order to freeze out a 9% minority shareholder interest. The Tax Court held that the transactions did not constitute a reorganization at all and that the new corporation was entitled to carry back its losses to the pre-merger tax years of its predecessor.\n\nReef Corp. v. Commissioner, supra, involved the merger of one corporation into a different shell corporation, together with the redemption of a 48% minority shareholder interest in the old corporation. There it was the government that urged that the 48% change in proprietary interest did not strip the transactions of their \u00a7 368(a)(1)(F) character for purposes of the accounting provisions of \u00a7 381(b). The court agreed that there had been an (F) reorganization.\n\nIn Gordon v. Commissioner, supra, 424 F.2d at 384, in the context of applying \u00a7 368(a)(1)(F) to \u00a7 354(b), we expressed some doubt whether a complete identity of shareholder interest is \"an indispensable condition to the invocation of Section 368(a)(1)(F).\"\n\nThe Code deals extensively with the tax consequences of redemptions. See \u00a7 302 et seq. Those provisions represent a comprehensive set of rules relating to the problems of partial and complete redemptions. Clearly a corporation which merely 822*822 redeems its minority shareholders' stock has not undergone a reorganization at all under \u00a7 368(a)(1) and is entitled to carry back its losses under \u00a7 172. We see no reason why the result should be different simply because the redemption occurs in the course of merging one corporation into a different shell. Casco Products Corp. v. Commissioner, supra, 49 T.C. at 36; Reef Corp. v. Commissioner, supra, 368 F.2d at 134-38. If the redemption, reorganization and carryback provisions were not intended to preclude carrybacks where there has been a simple redemption, we do not believe those provisions should be construed to preclude the carryback here involved.\n\nAccepting arguendo the government's contention that Aetna Life had independent business reasons for freezing out the minority shareholders during the course of the merger of Old Aetna into New Aetna,[12] we do not believe that a redemption which occurs in the course of what otherwise would be a \u00a7 368(a)(1)(F) reorganization should strip the reorganization of its subsection (F) character. Even assuming that the merger could not be separated from the redemption, as apparently it was possible for the court to do in Reef Corp. v. Commissioner, supra, 368 F.2d at 134, we agree with the reasoning of the Fifth Circuit that a \"redemption is not a characteristic of a reorganization. . . .\" Id. at 136. This view also is implicit in the Tax Court's reasoning in Casco Products Corp. v. Commissioner, supra.[13]\n\nWe believe that where the issue is whether a corporation is entitled to a carryback after a corporate reorganization, \u00a7 368(a)(1)(F) should be construed with particular sensitivity to the purposes of \u00a7 381(b). The interplay between subsections (F) and (A)-(E) gains its principal significance under the Code through the application of \u00a7 381(b). Since New Aetna was merely a corporate shell with no business of its own, none of the accounting problems which motivated \u00a7 381(b)(3) is present here.[14] Indeed, since New Aetna had no pre-reorganization tax history of its own, application here of the carryback prohibition contained in \u00a7 381(b)(3) would prevent New Aetna from obtaining any carryback of its current losses, even though \u00a7 381(b)(3) does not prevent acquiring corporations in other types of reorganizations from carrying back losses to their own pre-reorganization tax years. We do not believe that the mere fact that a redemption has occurred should lead to so Draconian a result, particularly since \u00a7 172 manifests a legislative policy in favor of carrybacks which ordinarily would not be affected by a simple redemption.\n\nMoreover, even assuming that \u00a7 368(a)(1)(F) should be given a fixed meaning in its application to the different provisions of the Code \u2014 a question which we need not decide here \u2014 our view of \u00a7 368(a)(1)(F) is not inconsistent with the implementation of those other provisions.\n\n823*823 In holding that the merger of Old Aetna into New Aetna did not qualify as a \u00a7 368(a)(1)(F) reorganization, the district court relied on Helvering v. Southwest Consolidated Corp., 315 U.S. 194, 202-03 (1942), where the Supreme Court stated that \"a transaction which shifts the ownership of the proprietary interest in a corporation is hardly `a mere change in identity, form, or place of organization' . . . .\" There the assets of an insolvent corporation were transferred to a new corporation which was owned and controlled by the old corporation's creditors. The shareholders of the old corporation received only a small minority interest in the new corporation. In determining whether there had been a \"sale\" of the old corporation's assets to the new corporation, or merely a reorganization, the Court dealt in one sentence with what is now \u00a7 368(a)(1)(F).\n\nHere, unlike Southwest Consolidated, there was merely a shift in the proprietary interest of the minority shareholders of Old Aetna. The transaction here involved cannot be described accurately as a \"sale\" of one corporation's assets to another corporation. We agree with the Fifth Circuit that the instant reorganization might begin to look more like a \"sale\" \u2014 or at least might look less like a \u00a7 368(a)(1)(F) reorganization and a redemption \u2014 \"if the change in proprietary interests were to new persons and less than 50% of the former stockholders' interest in the old corporation remained in the new corporation.\" Reef Corp. v. Commissioner, supra, 368 F.2d at 137. But that is not the situation here.[15]\n\nWe conclude that the reorganization of Old Aetna into New Aetna was a \u00a7 368(a)(1)(F) reorganization and that New Aetna is entitled to carryback its post-reorganization losses against the pre-organization income of Old Aetna pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 172 and 381(b)(3).\n\nReversed and remanded with directions to enter judgment for the taxpayer.", "ref_id": 36, "assigned_to": "gdeyesu@umaryland.edu"}}
